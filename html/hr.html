2D Array - DS

Problem Statement
You are given a 6*6 2D array. An hourglass in an array is a portion shaped like 
this:

a b c
  d
e f g

For example, if we create an hourglass using the number 1 within an array full 
of zeros, it may look like this:

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

Actually there are many hourglasses in the array above. The three leftmost 
hourglasses are the following:

1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
  1         0         0
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0

The sum of an hourglass is the sum of all the numbers within it. The sum for 
the hourglasses above are 7, 4, and 2, respectively.

In this problem you have to print the largest sum among all the hourglasses in 
the array.

Input Format
There will be exactly 6 lines, each containing 6 integers seperated by spaces. 
Each integer will be between -9 and 9 inclusive.

Output Format
Print the answer to this problem on a single line.

Time Delta

Problem Statement
Timestamps are given in the format:
Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx
Here +xxxx represents the timezone. See sample below for details.

Task 
Given 2 timestamps, print the absolute difference (in seconds) between them.

Input Format 
First line contains T representing T testcases. 
Each testcase contains 2 lines, representing time t1 and time t2.

Output Format 
Print the absolute difference (t1−t2) in seconds.

It is guaranteed that input contains only valid timestamps and the year can 
reach up to 3000.

Solution (2 days)
This is the first real problem requiring an understanding of how to go through 
documentation to find a solution that is "good enough".
I learned that, in general, computers and time are difficult to combine.
Also, the real problem was that I wrote "import datetime" in my original code.
It should have been "from datetime import datetime", similar but two days 
difference in solving the problem.

from datetime import datetime
I=[[datetime.strptime(input(),'%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z') for x in range(2)] for 
_ in range(int(input()))]
O=[abs(x[0]-x[1]).total_seconds() for x in I]
for x in O:
    print(int(x))

DefaultDict Tutorial

Problem Statement
DefaultDict is a container in the collections class of Python. It is almost the 
same as the usual dictionary (dict) container but with one difference. The 
value fields' data-type is specified upon initialization. 
A basic snippet showing the usage follows:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print i
This prints:

('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
('something-else', ['not relevant'])
In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers (n and m) and n words which 
might repeat, say they belong to a word group A. Then you'll be given m other 
words belonging to word group B. For each of these m words, you have to check 
whether the word has appeared in A or not. If it has then you have to print 
indices of all of its occurrences. If it has not then just print −1.

Constraints 
1&lt;:n&lt;:10000 
1&lt;:m&lt;:100 
1&lt;:length of each word in the input&lt;:100
Input Format

The first line contains n and m. 
The next n lines contain the words belonging to A. 
The next m lines contain the words belonging to B.

Output Format
Output m lines. 
The ith line should contain the 1 indexed positions of occurrences of the ith 
word, separated by spaces, of the last m lines of the input.

List Comprehensions
Lets learn about list comprehensions!
You are given three integers X, Y and Z denoting the dimensions of a Cuboid.
You have to print a list of all possible coordinates on the three dimensional 
grid, such that at any point the sum Xi + Yi + Zi is not equal to N.

The same applies to Y and Z.

Input Format
Four integers X, Y, Z and N in four different lines.

Output Format
You have to print the list, in increasing order.

Solution (20m)
There is a better way to do this, but this works for now.
Also, python should have primitive support for multidimensional comprehension.

M=[1+int(input()) for x in range(3)]
N=int(input())
T=[[x,y,z] for x in range(M[0]) for y in range(M[1]) for z in range(M[2])]

Tuples

Task 
You are given an integer N in one line.
The next line contains N space-separated integers.
Create a tuple of those N integers.

Compute hash(T) and print it.
Note hash() is one of the function in __builtins__ module.

Input Format 
The first line contains N.
The next line contains N space-separated integer values.

Output Format 
Print the computed value.

Solution (4m)

input()
print(hash(tuple([int(x) for x in input().split()])))


Lists
Task 
You have to initialize your list L = [] and follow the N commands given in N 
lines.
x.append(y)    # add y to the end of the list x (k: x,y)
x.extend(y)    # join the list y to the end of the list x (k: x,y)
x.insert(y,z)  # insert z at index z in x
x.remove(y)    # remove first occurrence of y in x 
x.pop()        # give last item of x and remove last item of x from x
x.pop(y)       # give x[y] and remove x[y] from x
x.index(y)     # give index of first occurrence of y in x (error otherwise)
x.count(y)     # give count of occurrences of y in x
x.sort()       # sort x in increasing
x.reverse()    # reverse the order of items of x
Commands will be 1 of the 8 commands as given above, other than extend, and 
each command will have its value separated by space.

Solution (20m Took time to find x.join(y) method for a string x)

L=[]
I=[input().split() for x in range(int(input()))] # input

Finding the percentage

Problem Statement
There is a record of 'n' students, each record having name of student, percent 
marks obtained in Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
Marks can be floating values.
The user enters an integer 'n' followed by names and marks for the 'n' students.
You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type.
The user then enters name of a student and you are required to print the 
average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal 
places.

d={x[0]: [float(y) for y in x[1:]] for x in I}    #dictionary
a=d[input()] #entry
print("{0:.2f}".format(sum(a)/len(a))) #output



Interchange Two Numbers
This is a poorly written question, it even tries to force you to use tuples.
Here is a solution that uses tuples in the way that I can best think it wants:

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
a,b=b,a
print(a)
print(b)

or perhaps

a,b=int(input()),int(input())
a,b=b,a
print(a,b)

Print triangle like:
1
22
333
4444
etc..

for i in range(1,input()):
	print(i*(10**i-1)/9)


Read an integer n and print a list of the squares of each integer from 0 to n-1

n=int(raw_input());
for i in range(0,n):
    print(i**2)

Input and Output

Problem Statement
For any program that we write the basic things that we need to do is take the 
input and print the expected output.

In C++ you can take the input using cin and print the output using cout.Unlike 
C where you need the format specifier in printf and scanf, here you can use cin 
and cout.

Taking Input:
If you want to input a number: cin&gt;&gt;n ,  where n is the number.
If you want to input a number and a string: cin&gt;&gt;n&gt;&gt;s, where s is 
the string.

Printing output:
If you want to output a single number: cout&lt;&lt;n
If you want to output a number and a string separated by a new line: 
cout&lt;&lt;n&lt;&lt;endl&lt;&lt;s (where endl moves the pinter to the new line 
and then string gets printed.)
Take three numbers as inputs and print the sum of the three numbers.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains three integers A,B and C.
(1&lt;|= &amp; &lt;|=1000) 2\ A,B,C

Output Format
In a single line print the sum of the three numbers.

Solution

#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

    cout&lt;&lt;a+b+c;
    return 0;
}


Hello, World !

Problem Statement
Let's start with the mandatory ritual. Print the string "Hello, World!". You 
can either use printf (preferred for this tutorial) or cout.

Solution

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}


Library Fine

Problem Statement
The Head Librarian at a library wants you to make a program that calculates the 
fine for returning the book after the return date.
You are given the actual and the expected return dates.
Calculate the fine as follows:
If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be 
charged, in other words fine is 0.
If the book is returned in the same month as the expected return date, Fine = 
15 Hackos * Number of late days
If the book is not returned in the same month but in the same year as the 
expected return date, 
Fine = 500 Hackos * Number of late months
If the book is not returned in the same year, the fine is fixed at 10000 Hackos.

Input Format
You are given the actual and the expected return dates in D M Y format 
respectively.
There are two lines of input.
The first line contains the D M Y values for the actual return date.
The next line contains the D M Y values for the expected return date.

Constraints 
1&lt;:D&lt;:31 
1&lt;:M&lt;:12 
1&lt;:Y&lt;:3000

Output Format
Output a single value equal to the fine.
