Solution (50m)
I made a dirty recursive solution first, but it took too long to run on the larger lists, so I turned it into a loopy solution (which is ugly).

Recursive solution (ugly to some people)
def q(x): return 'Yes' if len(x)&lt;=2 else q(x[1:-1]) if min(x[1],x[-2])&lt;=max(x[0],x[-1]) else 'No'
I=[[int(x) for x in input().split()] for _ in range(2*int(input()))]
for x in I[1::2]: print(q(x))

Loopy solution (ugly to some people, though clearly faster because people don't like to optimize recursion since it's hard)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    l,r=0,int(input())-1
    L=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
    q='Yes'
    while(l&lt;r):
        if min(L[l+1],L[r-1])&gt;max(L[l],L[r]):
            q='No'
            break
        l+=1
        r-=1
    print(q)




Word Order

Problem Statement
You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, you have to output its number of occurences. But the output order should correspond with the order of the first appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification. Note that each line in the input ends with a "\n" character.

Constraints: 
1&lt;:n&lt;:105 
Sum of lengths of all the words do not exceed 106 
All words are composed of lowercase-latin alphabets only.

Input Format
First line contains n. 
n lines follow, ith one contains the ith word.

Your initial happiness is 0 and for each integer in the array, i, if i∈A, you add 1 to your happiness, if i∈B, you add −1 to your happiness, else your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

Note that since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. But, the array might contain duplicate elements.

Constraints 
1&lt;|=n&lt;|=105 
1&lt;|=m&lt;|=105 
1&lt;|=Any integer in the input&lt;|=109

Input Format

DefaultDict Tutorial

Problem Statement
DefaultDict is a container in the collections class of Python. It is almost the same as the usual dictionary (dict) container but with one difference. The value fields' data-type is specified upon initialization. 
A basic snippet showing the usage follows:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print i
This prints:

('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
('something-else', ['not relevant'])
In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers (n and m) and n words which might repeat, say they belong to a word group A. Then you'll be given m other words belonging to word group B. For each of these m words, you have to check whether the word has appeared in A or not. If it has then you have to print indices of all of its occurrences. If it has not then just print −1.

Constraints 
1&lt;:n&lt;:10000 
1&lt;:m&lt;:100 
1&lt;:length of each word in the input&lt;:100
Input Format

The first line contains n and m. 
The next n lines contain the words belonging to A. 
The next m lines contain the words belonging to B.

Output Format
Output m lines. 
The ith line should contain the 1 indexed positions of occurrences of the ith word, separated by spaces, of the last m lines of the input.

Solution (5m)
(I did not solve it as they asked, I did it "the right way" :)
(Also, vector/tree extensions of basic arithmetic operations are desperately needed)

import itertools
def where(x):
    return itertools.chain.from_iterable([[i]*j for i,j in enumerate(x)])

I=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
A=[input() for x in range(I[0])]
B=[input() for x in range(I[1])]
W=[list(where([x==y for x in A])) for y in B]
O=[[1+x for x in y] for y in W]
for x in O:
    if x==[]:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(*x)

About Game

Rules
The game is a two player game. Players are given a string S.
Both the players have to make words using the letters of string S.
Player 1 has to make words starting with consonants.
Player 2 has to make words starting with vowels. 
Game ends when both players have made all possible substrings. 

Scoring
Player get +1 Point for each occurrence of the word in the string S.
Example:
If string S = BANANA
Word made by Player 2 = ANA
'ANA' is occuring twice in 'BANANA'. Hence, Player 2 will get 2 Points.

Input Format
Single line containing string S. 
Note: String S contains only capital alphabets [A-Z].

Constraints
0&lt;len(S)&lt;=106

Output Format
Print the name of the winner along with the total score.

List Comprehensions
Lets learn about list comprehensions!
You are given three integers X, Y and Z denoting the dimensions of a Cuboid.
You have to print a list of all possible coordinates on the three dimensional grid, such that at any point the sum Xi + Yi + Zi is not equal to N.
If X = 2, then possible values of Xi can be 0, 1 and 2.
The same applies to Y and Z.

Input Format
Four integers X, Y, Z and N in four different lines.

Output Format
You have to print the list, in increasing order.

Solution (20m)
There is a better way to do this, but this works for now.
Also, python should have primitive support for multidimensional comprehension.

M=[1+int(input()) for x in range(3)]
N=int(input())
T=[[x,y,z] for x in range(M[0]) for y in range(M[1]) for z in range(M[2])]
L=[]

Problem Statement
Lets learn about a new datatype 'sets'!
You are given two set of integers M and N and you have to print their symmetric difference in ascending order.
The first line of input contains value of M followed by M integers, then value of N followed by N integers.
Symmetric difference between M and N mean those values which either exist in M or in N but not in both.

Input Format

y=set(map(int,input().split()))
z=list((x.union(y)).difference(x.intersection(y)))
z.sort()
for u in z:
    print(u)

Tuples

Task 
You are given an integer N in one line.
The next line contains N space-separated integers.
Create a tuple of those N integers.
Lets call it T. 
Compute hash(T) and print it.
Note hash() is one of the function in __builtins__ module.

Input Format 
The first line contains N.
The next line contains N space-separated integer values.

Output Format 
Print the computed value.

Solution (4m)

input()
print(hash(tuple([int(x) for x in input().split()])))


Lists
Task 
You have to initialize your list L = [] and follow the N commands given in N lines.
x.append(y)    # add y to the end of the list x (k: x,y)
x.extend(y)    # join the list y to the end of the list x (k: x,y)
x.insert(y,z)  # insert z at index z in x
x.remove(y)    # remove first occurrence of y in x 
x.pop()        # give last item of x and remove last item of x from x
x.pop(y)       # give x[y] and remove x[y] from x
x.index(y)     # give index of first occurrence of y in x (error otherwise)
x.count(y)     # give count of occurrences of y in x
x.sort()       # sort x in increasing
x.reverse()    # reverse the order of items of x
Commands will be 1 of the 8 commands as given above, other than extend, and each command will have its value separated by space.

Solution (20m Took time to find x.join(y) method for a string x)

Finding the percentage

Problem Statement
There is a record of 'n' students, each record having name of student, percent marks obtained in Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
Marks can be floating values.
The user enters an integer 'n' followed by names and marks for the 'n' students.
You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type.
The user then enters name of a student and you are required to print the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

Input Format
Integer N followed by name and marks for N students, followed by the name of the particular student.

Output Format
Average percentage of marks obtained

Constraints 
2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 
0 &lt;= Marks &lt;= 100

Solution (30min, I didn't know string.split() tokenized as I wanted)

I=[input().split() for x in range(int(input()))]  #input
d={x[0]: [float(y) for y in x[1:]] for x in I}    #dictionary
a=d[input()] #entry
print("{0:.2f}".format(sum(a)/len(a))) #output



Interchange Two Numbers
This is a poorly written question, it even tries to force you to use tuples.
Here is a solution that uses tuples in the way that I can best think it wants:

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
a,b=b,a
print(a)
print(b)

or perhaps

a,b=int(input()),int(input())
a,b=b,a
print(a,b)

Print triangle like:
1
22
333
4444
etc..

for i in range(1,input()):
	print(i*(10**i-1)/9)


Read an integer n and print a list of the squares of each integer from 0 to n-1

n=int(raw_input());
for i in range(0,n):
    print(i**2)

Input and Output

Problem Statement
For any program that we write the basic things that we need to do is take the input and print the expected output.

In C++ you can take the input using cin and print the output using cout.Unlike C where you need the format specifier in printf and scanf, here you can use cin and cout.

Taking Input:
If you want to input a number: cin&gt;&gt;n ,  where n is the number.
If you want to input a number and a string: cin&gt;&gt;n&gt;&gt;s, where s is the string.

Printing output:
If you want to output a single number: cout&lt;&lt;n
If you want to output a number and a string separated by a new line: cout&lt;&lt;n&lt;&lt;endl&lt;&lt;s (where endl moves the pinter to the new line and then string gets printed.)
Take three numbers as inputs and print the sum of the three numbers.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains three integers A,B and C.
(1&lt;|= &amp; &lt;|=1000) 2\ A,B,C

Output Format
In a single line print the sum of the three numbers.

Let's start with the mandatory ritual. Print the string "Hello, World!". You can either use printf (preferred for this tutorial) or cout.

Solution

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}


Library Fine

Problem Statement
The Head Librarian at a library wants you to make a program that calculates the fine for returning the book after the return date.
You are given the actual and the expected return dates.
Calculate the fine as follows:
If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged, in other words fine is 0.
If the book is returned in the same month as the expected return date, Fine = 15 Hackos * Number of late days
If the book is not returned in the same month but in the same year as the expected return date, 
Fine = 500 Hackos * Number of late months
If the book is not returned in the same year, the fine is fixed at 10000 Hackos.

Input Format
You are given the actual and the expected return dates in D M Y format respectively.
There are two lines of input.
The first line contains the D M Y values for the actual return date.
The next line contains the D M Y values for the expected return date.

Constraints 
1&lt;:D&lt;:31 
1&lt;:M&lt;:12 
1&lt;:Y&lt;:3000

Output Format
Output a single value equal to the fine.

Solution (29m, I've gotta stop watching X-Files)

Solution (31m, took me a while to find %02i for 00 output format)
typedef int I;typedef char C;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define I(e...) scanf(e)
#define O(e...) printf(e)
main(){I h,m,s;C x;I("%i:%i:%i%cM",&amp;h,&amp;m,&amp;s,&amp;x);O("%02i:%02i:%02i",h+12*((x=='P')-(h==12)),m,s);}


Staircase

Problem Statement
Your teacher has given you the task to draw the structure of a staircase. 
Being an expert programmer, you decided to make a program for the same. 
You are given the height of the staircase.
You need to print a staircase as shown in the example.

Input Format
You are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.

Constraints 
1&lt;:N&lt;:100

Output Format
Draw a staircase of height N like:
     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######

Solution (1h, with X-Files :) )
I looked for an equivalent to a[3]={0} but with '#' for 0.
a[100]={'#'} only makes a[1]=='#' so I use J(n,a[j]='#')

typedef int I;typedef char C;
#define J(n,e...) {I j=0,Mj=(n);for(;j&lt;Mj;++j){e;}}
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define I(e...) scanf(e)
#define O(e...) printf(e)
main(){I n;C a[100];I("%i",&amp;n);J(n,a[j]='#');J(n,O("%*.*s",n,1+j,a))}


Plus Minus

Problem Statement
You're given an array containing integer values.
You need to print the fraction of count of positive numbers, negative numbers and zeroes to the total numbers.
Print the value of the fractions correct to 3 decimal places.

Output Format
Output three values on different lines equal to the fraction of count of positive numbers, negative numbers and zeroes to the total numbers respectively correct to 3 decimal places.

Solution (1h, with dinner ;) )

typedef int I;
#define J(n,e...) {I j=0,Mj=(n);for(;j&lt;Mj;++j){e;}}
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define I(e...) scanf(e)
#define O(e...) printf(e)
main(){I n,x,a[3]={0};I("%i",&amp;n);J(n,I("%i",&amp;x),++a[(x&lt;=0)+(x==0)];);J(3,O("%.3f\n",1.0*a[j]/n));}
