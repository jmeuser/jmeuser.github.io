Notes on Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ Second Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup

Part I The Basics

Chapter 2 Hello, World!

2.2 The classic first program

// This program outputs the message "Hello, World!" to the monitor
#include "std_lib_facilities.h"

int main()  // C++ programs start by executing the function main
{
 cout&lt;&lt;"Hello, World!\n"; // output "Hello, World!"
 return 0;
}

Noun      Definition
"string"  string
cout      character output stream
//comment everything after // is ignored by the compiler
.h        header file
main()    where every C++ program starts executing

Four Pats of a Function
Part            Definition
return type     what the function gives back
name            how we refer to the function
parameter list  enclosed in ()
function body   enclosed in {}


2.3 Compilation

Noun         Definition
source code  program text with .cpp file suffix
object code  machine code executed by the computer
compiler     transforms source code to object code


2.4 Linking

Noun                Definition
linker              puts together object files (translation units) to form an executable
library             code accessed using declarations (found in an #include file)
declaration         program statement specifying how a piece of code can be used
compile-time error  errors found by the compiler
link-time errors    errors found by the linker
run-time errors     logical errors found when a program is executed (run)
