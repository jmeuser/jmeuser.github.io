Data Structures

Nodes, Fields, Links
"
The information in a table consists of a set of nodes (called "records," 
"entities," or "beads" by some authors); we will occasionally say "item" or 
"element" instead of "node." Each node consists of one or more consecutive 
words of the computer memory, divided into named parts called fields.
" Knuth TAOCP V1 3rd ed pg. 233

"
The address of a nod, also called a link, pointer, or reference to that node, 
is the memory location of its first word. The address is often taken relative 
to some base location, but in this chapter for simplicity we will take the 
address to be an absolute memory location.
" Knuth TAOCP V1 3rd ed pg. 233

A node is one or more consecutive words of computer memory divided into named 
parts called fields
The address of, or a link to, a node is the memory location of its first word.


Linear Lists

Stacks, Queues, and Deque

"
A linear list is a sequence of n&gt;= nodes X[1], X[2],...,X[n] whose essential 
structural properties involve only the relative positions between items as they 
appear in a line. The only things we care about in such structures are the 
facts that, if n &gt; 0, X[1] is the first node and X[n] is the last; and if 1 
&lt; k &lt; n, the nth node X[k] is preceded by X[k-1] and followed by X[k+1].
