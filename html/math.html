Introduction of Numerals

A numeral is an occurrence of a zero or an occurrence of a successor of a numeral.
A numeral system is a collection of methods for introducing an occurrence of zero and introducing the successor of a numeral of the system.

Our first numeral system uses these rules:
1 write '0'; and
2 write '1+ 0' for '0' in a numeral.
Rule 1 gives the zero numeral and rule 2 gives the successor of a numeral of this system.

Here are example applications of these rules:

--- 1
 0


-------- 1
 0
-------- 2
 1+ 0
-------- 2
 1+ 1+ 0


 1+ 1+ 0
------------------ 2
 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
------------------ 2
 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
------------------ 2
 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0


Consequently,
0
1+ 0
1+ 1+ 0
1+ 1+ 1+ 0
1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
are occurrences of numerals of this system.

It is possible to begin by constructing the familiar Hindu-Arabic positional numeral system.
The apparent complexity of the rules needed to do so dissuades their immediate introduction.
Alternatively, it can be introduced as an abbreviation for numerals of the current system.
Rather than give the entire system of abbreviation in full it will be given as needed.

Copying

All of math and science are born from and reducible to imitation and repetition.
Imitation is the behavior of performing similar behaviors.
It is possible to condition the performance of similar behaviors without observing imitation.
Thus, the occurrence of similar events of human behavior is not necessarily imitation.

Prior to similar events of human behavior were occurrences of similar events.
The extent to which we can clearly and exactly identify and describe the occurrence of similar events is often how we measure progress in math and science.

Copying is a type of imitation.
Copying is used to record events.
Some consequents of copying are more similar than others.

Abstraction, as an activity, is born from errors in imitation.

Similarity may also be seen as errors between occurrences of events.
Without errors between events, similarity would reduce to sameness making the occurrence of any event indistinguishable from the occurrence of another.
That different events occur seems to be basic.


Counting Small Collections

Counting is a foundation and origin of math.
To count is to name a tally.
A tally is a copy of a collection in marks.

  apple        orange       pear    collection
---------   -----------   -------   copy
.           | |       |   *   * *   tally 
  . . . .       |   |       *
                  |

A tally, being a collection of marks, can be copied.

.           | |       |   *   * *
  . . . .       |   |       *
                  |               collection
---------   -----------   ------- copy
|   |   |     * * * *     .       tally
  |   |     *         *     .
                              .
                                .

A tally tallies itself.
Systematic methods of tallying turn into counting.
Counting, as we know it, is an efficient way to record and communicate acts of imitation or, specifically, copying.


Counting Large Collections

Use an abacus.


Numerals

Numerals are introduced to abbreviate counting.
Some numeral systems are designed so that more complex mathematical activities can be performed quickly and consistently.

Modern decimal notation using Hindu-Arabic numerals has replaced almost all previously created numeral systems.
This is due primarily to its use in performing the fundamental algorithms of arithmetic:
addition;
multiplication;
subtraction; and
division.

The conceptual origins of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is in the use of the abacus to count large collections.

The act of copying an object from a collection in the acts of moving beads is encoded in a Hindu-Arabic numeral.

The numeral 123 abbreviates the events between the following antecedent and consequent of counting with an abacus

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o

   o    o    o 
   o    o    o

   o    o    o 
   o    o    | 
   o    |    o 
   |    o    o     
   o    o    o
 ===============

Whatever meaning we give to numerals and their use to count or record counts comes from the inference or induction we make from our records of events to the events that may have brought about those records.

By abstracting from counting with an abacus we can examine numeral independent of its occurrences or interpretations.
We do this to identify the unavoidable constraints on any numeral system we might decide to design in the future.

In anticipation of addition the notion of numeral is encoded with a verb "next numeral" denoted by '1+' and an initial noun zero denoted by '0'.

Here 1+0 might be interpreted as the following abacus events:

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o

 ===============

In general, a numeral is any system sufficiently similar to the following rules


--- Introduce Zero
 0

 0
--- Introduce Next Numeral
1+0

These rules are purely constructive, that is they are not conservative i.e. do not have symmetric elimination rules.

An example sequence of events following these rules:

----- Introduce Zero
  0
----- Introduce Next Numeral
1+0
----- Introduce Next numeral
1+1+0

Notice, these rules are all instances of copying with systematic errors.
The rule "introduce zero" is a command to copy nothing while introducing an error that looks like '0'.
The rule "introduce next numeral" is a command to copy an occurrence of '0' as an occurrence of '1+0'.
Specifically, in '1+0' the expression might be copied in the following stages

1
1+      this is the stage where the copy-error is introduced
1+1
1+1+
1+1+0

The reason for continuing to examine these excruciatingly "common/simple/basic" parts of math is because it really is the conceptual foundation for all modern mathematical behavior.


Elimination of numerals may be interpreted using modular arithmetic.


A Collection of Introduction and Elimination Schema

Iterative Definition Schema

The following pair of familiar expressions are given by Goodstein in RNT on pg. 18

"
The common feature of all the definitions A to S is apparent; each definition takes the form

F(x,0)=a(x)
F(x,Sy)=b(x,F(x,y))

where F(x,y) is the function defined and a(x), b(x,y) are functions previously define for are variables or definite numerals.
" Goodstein RNT pg. 18

I've gone ahead and written them using the notation from his book, the classical notation.

Though his expression and discussion are consistent with his methods, they are not as transparent in their meaning as the following graphic presented using introduction and elimination rules via event schema.
The following are written using N notation.

      a y                 0 f y
    ----- introduce       ----- eliminate
    0 f y                   a y

y b x f y               S.x f y
--------- introduce   --------- eliminate
  S.x f y             y b x f y

The reason these schema are more representative of their use in defining functions is because they provide a sense of direction and show that the iterative schema of definition is conservative.
Specifically, one can not build an expression containing f without having established an expression from a or an expression from b and f of a certain form.
That this definition is "conservative" and is given by the symmetry of the introduction and elimination rules.
The pairing is important, and is the distinguishing feature of Goodstein's system.
Furthermore these schema give a guide for any notation hoping to capture definition by iteration for any future notation.

This iterative schema of definition is extracted from the similarity of the form of the defining equations for the following elementary arithmetic acts:

"
In standardized notation the definitions A, M, E, T and S take the forms

A
Sum(x,0)=x
Sum(x,Sy)=S(Sum(x,y))

M
Prod(x,0)=0
Prod(x,Sy)=Sum(x,Prod(x,y))

E
Exp(x,0)=1
Exp(x, Sy)=Prod(x,Exp(x,y))

T
Tet(x,0)=1
Tet(x,Sy)=Exp(x,Tet(x,y))

S
Dif(x,0)=x
Dif(x,Sy)=P(Dif(x,y))

where P(x) is x-.1 defined by

P(0)=0
PSx=x.
" Goodstein RNT pg.18

Goodstein then identifies what anyone would after looking at the iterative schema for definition long enough and wondering why b does not use y as one of its arguments.

"
Definition scheme I is called iteration; definition by iteration is a particular case of definition by RECURSION of which the scheme is

R
F(x,0)=a(x)
F(x,Sy)=b(x,y,F(x,y))

(The difference between iteration and recursion is that in the latter, function b depends upon y as well as upon x and F(x,y).)
" Goodstein RNT pg. 19

Using schema of a more modern form and the notational conventions of N the schema of recursive definition is depicted as follows:

          a y                     0 f y
        ----- introduce           ----- eliminate
        0 f y                       a y

(x,y) b x f y                   S.x f y
------------- introduce   ------------- eliminate
      S.x f y             (x,y) b x f y

Though, this is not how an experienced user of N notation would write these schema.
They would use the power of forks, and their abundance in everyday arithmetic to writhe these schema as follows:

      a y                 0 f y
    ----- introduce       ----- eliminate
    0 f y                   a y

x , b f y               S.x f y
--------- introduce   --------- eliminate
  S.x f y             x , b f y

For those unfamiliar with N's use of forks and hooks the expression 'x , b f y' is calculate as follows:

    x , b f y
----------------- eliminate fork
(x , y) b (x f y)

which gives the same expression as in the previous non-forked expression.
Why use forks?
Because under these schema definition and using N's tacit verb concept we can write:

  {0 f y} = {a y}
{S.x f y} = , b f

Or if one wanted to make expressions that are, in my opinion, more distinct and clear in their meaning and use of constant and projection functions:

 {0} f {y} =   a {y}
S{x} f {y} = , b f

Both expression are actually a pair of verbs/abbreviations/functions(but not 'real' functions) themselves: they are not what a classical algebra student would interpret as a statement of equality.
This seems weird at first and pointless if you are not aware of how Goodstein uses equality.
His expressions, and his entire formal primitive recursive arithmetic, never explicitly uses functions: it uses symbols for what most people would call functions.
This subtlety seems to have been missed by anyone who has read his work.
