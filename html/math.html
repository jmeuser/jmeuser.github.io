Math is a story.
Its plot gives power.
Its morals give wisdom.
This is my telling of the math story.

I've added little, perhaps nothing, to the math story.
I only retell the stories I've heard.

The storytellers I've learned from are

Bertrand Russell
R. L. Goodstein
Saunders MacLane
Stephen Cole Kleene
Donald E. Knuth
Nicolas Bourbaki
Tian-Xia He

Names are added as they occur to me.
For now, I'm retelling Goodstein's 'Fundamental concepts of Mathematics'.


Copying

All of math and science are born from and reducible to imitation.
Imitation is the behavior of performing similar behaviors.
It is possible to condition the performance of similar behaviors without observing imitation.
Thus, the occurrence of similar events of human behavior is not necessarily imitation.

Prior to similar events of human behavior were occurrences of similar events.
The extent to which we can clearly and exactly identify and describe the occurrence of similar events is often how we measure progress in math and science.

Copying is a type of imitation.
Copying is used to record events.
Some consequents of copying are more similar than others.

Abstraction, as an activity, is born from errors in imitation.

Similarity may also be seen as errors between occurrences of events.
Without errors between events, similarity would reduce to sameness making the occurrence of any event indistinguishable from the occurrence of another.
That different events occur seems to be basic.


Counting Small Collections

Counting is a foundation and origin of math.
To count is to name a tally.
A tally is a copy of a collection in marks.

  apple        orange       pear    collection
---------   -----------   -------   copy
.           | |       |   *   * *   tally 
  . . . .       |   |       *
                  |

A tally, being a collection of marks, can be copied.

.           | |       |   *   * *
  . . . .       |   |       *
                  |               collection
---------   -----------   ------- copy
|   |   |     * * * *     .       tally
  |   |     *         *     .
                              .
                                .

A tally tallies itself.
Systematic methods of tallying turn into counting.
Counting, as we know it, is an efficient way to record and communicate acts of imitation or, specifically, copying.


Counting Large Collections

Use an abacus.


Numerals

Numerals are introduced to abbreviate counting.
Some numeral systems are designed so that more complex mathematical activities can be performed quickly and consistently.

Modern decimal notation using Hindu-Arabic numerals has replaced almost all previously created numeral systems.
This is due primarily to its use in performing the fundamental algorithms of arithmetic:
addition;
multiplication;
subtraction; and
division.

The conceptual origins of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is in the use of the abacus to count large collections.

The act of copying an object from a collection in the acts of moving beads is encoded in a Hindu-Arabic numeral.

The numeral 123 abbreviates the events between the following antecedent and consequent of counting with an abacus

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o     
   |    |    |
 ===============  antecedent
----------------- intermedient
 ===============  consequent
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    | 
   o    |    o 
   |    o    o     
   o    o    o
 ===============

Whatever meaning we give to numerals and their use to count or record counts comes from the inference or induction we make from our records of events to the events that may have brought about those records.

By abstracting from counting with an abacus we can examine numeral independent of its occurrences or interpretations.
We do this to identify the unavoidable constraints on any numeral system we might decide to design in the future.

In anticipation of addition the notion of numeral is encoded with a verb "next numeral" denoted by '1+' and an initial noun zero denoted by '0'.

Here 1+0 might be interpreted as the following abacus events:

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o     
   |    |    |
 ===============  0   antecedent
----------------- 1+  act
 ===============  1+0 consequent
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    |     
   |    |    o
 ===============

Another example, now with 1+1+1+0

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o     
   |    |    |
 ===============  0   antecedent

 ===============  1+0 consequent

 ===============  1+1+1+0 consequent
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o

   o    o    o

 ===============

In general, a numeral is any system sufficiently similar to the following rules


--- Introduce Zero
 0

 0
--- Introduce Next Numeral
1+0

These rules are purely constructive, that is they are not conservative i.e. do not have symmetric elimination rules.

An example sequence of events following these rules:

----- Introduce Zero
  0
----- Introduce Next Numeral
1+0
----- Introduce Next numeral
1+1+0

Notice, these rules are all instances of copying with systematic errors.
The rule "introduce zero" is a command to copy nothing while introducing an error that looks like '0'.
The rule "introduce next numeral" is a command to copy an occurrence of '0' as an occurrence of '1+0'.
Specifically, in '1+0' the expression might be copied in the following stages

1
1+      this is the stage where the copy-error is introduced
1+1
1+1+
1+1+0

The reason for continuing to examine these excruciatingly "common/simple/basic" parts of math is because it really is the conceptual foundation for all modern mathematical behavior.
