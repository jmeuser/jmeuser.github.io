The notation used here is highly idiomatic and mnemonic.
It is inspired by Iverson's J and APL, and Whitney's k.
Its use as a tool for thinking about math is inspired by Goodstein.

There is one order of operations: expressions are evaluated from right to left.
Expressions are read aloud from left to right.

!0 gives the empty or null list ()

Rather than write

   !0     input     antecedent
--------- calculate action
   ()     output    consequent

we write

   !0
()

so that the antecedent event is preceded by some space and the output is not.
This sequence of events is read "enumerate zero gives the null list".
Although a native English speaker might say "Enumerating zero gives the empty list".

This sequence of events shows the result of enumerate of a few natural numerals.

   !0
()
   !1
0
   !2
0 1
   !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   !15
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

We can describe ! in terms of itself using join.

   !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   (!9),9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

To show how to calculate (!9),9 we separate it into a sequence of intermediate events.

       (!9),9          enumerate nine join nine
---------------------  evaluate enumerate nine
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8),9  join the list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to nine
---------------------  calculate
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the vector 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Notice that there are many different ways of saying the same thing.
Only context can tell us why we might say things one way rather than another.
For example we could have written the previous sequence of events as follows:

      (!9),9
-------------------
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8,9
-------------------
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

The difference is subtle, and it often is, but some contexts benefit from the one over the other.
Here is a, seemingly complex, way of calculating the result of evaluating '!5'

                    !5
----------------------
                (!4),4
----------------------
            ((!3),3),4
----------------------
        (((!2),2),3),4
----------------------
    ((((!1),1),2),3),4
----------------------
(((((!0),0),1),2),3),4
----------------------
 ((((((),0),1),2),3),4
----------------------
     ((((0),1),2),3),4
----------------------
       (((0,1),2),3),4
----------------------
       (((0 1),2),3),4
----------------------
         ((0 1,2),3),4
----------------------
         ((0 1 2),3),4
----------------------
           (0 1 2,3),4
----------------------
           (0 1 2 3),4
----------------------
             0 1 2 3,4
----------------------
             0 1 2 3 4

Someone familiar with enumerate of a numeral would probably just write

   !5
0 1 2 3 4

Some people might say "count out five" for !5 or maybe "aufzuzählen fünf".

"Why use ! for enumerate when we already use it to talk about factorials?" you ask.
First, you can write */!n for the factorial of n-1.
Second, you can do much more with ! this way than as a factorial (MUCH more).
Third, calculating with factorial is difficult.
It occurs frequently, and grows fast.
It is only one of a large family of similar functions.
Pick your favorite binary operation T then T/!n gives you its factorial like extension.
In general T/a is read "T over a".
If a:2 4 0 1 12 then (T/a)=2 T 4 T 0 T 1 T 12.
If the idea of right to left evaluation is new you might prefer to think of it this way
(T/a) = (2 T(4 T(0 T(1 T 12))))
So if T:+ then (T/a)=+/a and
(+/a) = 2+4+0+1+12
So you might notice a familiar factorial like function with T:+
(+/!5) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
In general, if n is a natural numeral then
(+/!n)=(n-1)*n%2
We can prove this by induction on n.
First, we assume that n is a natural numeral and not something like a function or vector.
Notice that (+/!0)=+/() and 0=(0-1)*0%2 so that +/() should give 0 (and it does).
See that () looks like 0.
It often plays the same role as 0 when calculating with vectors.
So we know (+/!0)=(0-1)*0%2.
Suppose (+/!n)=(n-1)*n%2 for some numeral n.
By basic arithmetic and algebra the following list of expressions give the same numeral:
+/!1+n
+/(!n),n
(+/!n)+n
n++/!n
n+(n-1)*n%2
((2*n)+(n-1)*n)%2
(2+n-1)*n%2
(1+n)*n%2
(1+n)*(1+n-1)%2
This completes the induction.

Another familiar family of functions are the repeated T functions.
Again, pick your favorite dyad T then T/# gives its repeated extension.
We'll let T:+ in the following sequence of equivalent expressions.
3+/#4
+/3#4
+/4 4 4
4 + 4 + 4
12
Notice that 3+/#4 is the same as 3*4.
This is not surprising since multiplication is often synonymous with repeated addition.
We can continue this process to power or exponentiation:
3*/#4
*/3#4
*/4 4 4
4 * 4 * 4
64
The name for repeated exponentiation was created by Goodstein.
In the following expressions let T:*/#
3T/#4
T/3#4
T/4 4 4
4 */# 4 */# 4
13407807929942597099574024998205846127479365820592393377723561443721764030073546976801874298166903427690031858186486050853753882811946569946433649006084096
Which is an example of a number that would have given C programmers a small headache "back in the day".
The hierarchy of repeated extensions of + (or of succession) is very interesting.
As you climb up it's easy to make functions that grow faster than what we tend to imagine as being "fast".

(x^y)=*/x#y
(*/x#y)=x*/#y claws can be very helpful
(+/a*x^!#a)=+/a**/x#"!#a suggest dyadic ^ is suspect like ! as factorial.
(+/a*x^!#a)=*/b-x for some b with (#b)=#a (fundamental theorem of algebra) (add awesome generalizations that simplify)
