There is one order of operations: expressions are evaluated from right to left.
Expressions are read aloud from left to right.

!0 gives the empty or null list ()

Rather than write

   !0     input     antecedent
--------- calculate action
   ()     output    consequent

we write

   !0
()

so that the antecedent event is preceded by some space and the output is not.
This sequence of events is read "enumerate zero gives the null list".
Although a native English speaker might say "Enumerating zero gives the null list".

Here is a sequence of events meant to show the results of enumerate of a natural number.

   !0
()
   !1
0
   !2
0 1
   !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   !15
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

We can describe ! in terms of itself using join

   !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   (!9),9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

To show how to calculate (!9),9 we separate it into a sequence of intermediate events

       (!9),9          enumerate nine join nine
---------------------  evaluate enumerate nine
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8),9  join the list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to nine
---------------------  calculate
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the vector 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Notice that there are many different ways of saying the same thing.
Only context can tell us why we might say things one way rather than another.
For example we could have written the previous sequence of events as follows:

      (!9),9
-------------------
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8,9
-------------------
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

The difference is subtle, and it often is, but some context benefit from the one over the other.
