The notation used here is highly idiomatic and mnemonic.
It is inspired by Iverson's J and APL, and Whitney's k.
Its use as a tool for thinking about math is inspired by Goodstein.

There is one order of operations: expressions are evaluated from right to left.
Expressions are read aloud from left to right.

!0 gives the empty or null list ()

Rather than write

   !0     input     antecedent
--------- calculate action
   ()     output    consequent

we write

   !0
()

so that the antecedent event is preceded by some space and the output is not.
This sequence of events is read "enumerate zero gives the null list".
Although a native English speaker might say "Enumerating zero gives the empty list".

This sequence of events shows the result of enumerate of a few natural numerals.

   !0
()
   !1
0
   !2
0 1
   !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   !15
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

We can describe ! in terms of itself using join.

   !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   (!9),9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

To show how to calculate (!9),9 we separate it into a sequence of intermediate events.

       (!9),9          enumerate nine join nine
---------------------  evaluate enumerate nine
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8),9  join the list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to nine
---------------------  calculate
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the vector 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Notice that there are many different ways of saying the same thing.
Only context can tell us why we might say things one way rather than another.
For example we could have written the previous sequence of events as follows:

      (!9),9
-------------------
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8,9
-------------------
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

The difference is subtle, and it often is, but some contexts benefit from the one over the other.
Here is a, seemingly complex, way of calculating the result of evaluating '!5'

                    !5
----------------------
                (!4),4
----------------------
            ((!3),3),4
----------------------
        (((!2),2),3),4
----------------------
    ((((!1),1),2),3),4
----------------------
(((((!0),0),1),2),3),4
----------------------
 ((((((),0),1),2),3),4
----------------------
     ((((0),1),2),3),4
----------------------
       (((0,1),2),3),4
----------------------
       (((0 1),2),3),4
----------------------
         ((0 1,2),3),4
----------------------
         ((0 1 2),3),4
----------------------
           (0 1 2,3),4
----------------------
           (0 1 2 3),4
----------------------
             0 1 2 3,4
----------------------
             0 1 2 3 4

Someone familiar with enumerate of a numeral would probably just write

   !5
0 1 2 3 4

Some people might say "count out five" for !5 or maybe "aufzuzählen fünf".

"Why use ! for enumerate when we already use it to talk about factorials?" you ask.
First, you can write */!n for the factorial of n-1.
Second, you can do much more with ! this way than as a factorial (MUCH more).
Third, calculating with factorial is difficult.
It occurs frequently, and grows fast.
It is only one of a large family of similar functions.
Pick your favorite binary operation T then T/!n gives you its factorial like extension.
In general T/a is read "T over a".
If a:2 4 0 1 12 then (T/a)=2 T 4 T 0 T 1 T 12.
If the idea of right to left evaluation is new you might prefer to think of it this way
(T/a) = (2 T(4 T(0 T(1 T 12))))
So if T:+ then (T/a)=+/a and
(+/a) = 2+4+0+1+12
So you might notice a familiar factorial like function with T:+
(+/!5) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
In general, if n is a natural numeral then
(+/!n)=(n-1)*n%2
We can prove this by induction on n.
First, we assume that n is a natural numeral and not something like a function or vector.
Notice that (+/!0)=+/() and 0=(0-1)*0%2 so that +/() should give 0 (and it does).
See that () looks like 0.
It often plays the same role as 0 when calculating with vectors.
So we know (+/!0)=(0-1)*0%2.
Suppose (+/!n)=(n-1)*n%2 for some numeral n.
By basic arithmetic and algebra the following list of expressions give the same numeral:
+/!1+n
+/(!n),n
(+/!n)+n
n++/!n
n+(n-1)*n%2
((2*n)+(n-1)*n)%2
(2+n-1)*n%2
(1+n)*n%2
(1+n)*(1+n-1)%2
This completes the induction.

Another familiar family of functions are the repeated T functions.
Again, pick your favorite dyad T then T/# gives its repeated extension.
We'll let T:+ in the following sequence of equivalent expressions.
3+/#4
+/3#4
+/4 4 4
4 + 4 + 4
12
Notice that 3+/#4 is the same as 3*4.
This is not surprising since multiplication is often synonymous with repeated addition.
We can continue this process to power or exponentiation:
3*/#4
*/3#4
*/4 4 4
4 * 4 * 4
64
The name for repeated exponentiation was created by Goodstein: tetration.
In the following expressions let T:*/#
3T/#4
T/3#4
T/4 4 4
4 */# 4 */# 4
13407807929942597099574024998205846127479365820592393377723561443721764030073546976801874298166903427690031858186486050853753882811946569946433649006084096
Which is an example of a number that would have given C programmers a small headache "back in the day".
The hierarchy of repeated extensions of + (or of succession) is very interesting.
As you climb up it's easy to make functions that grow faster than what we tend to imagine as being "fast".

The number of items in a list is returned by count:
n=#!n
4=#4 4 4 4
(#1 2 3 4)=#0 1 2 3

Why use such a strange notation to say what we already say with regular math notation?
These notational conventions reveal similarities between operations that are often defined using wildly different notation or notions.
As has already been shown, any operation that is born from the repetition is give as T/#.
There is more to this notation if we consider binary operations as parametrized unary operations (this is in the spirit of currying, but has been surprisingly familiar to accountants around the world for a long while).
Suppose you ask an accounting to add the following list of numerals:
12 23 424 244 3535 54
If their calculator wasn’t already cleared they would clear it and start by typing 54 then + which would add 54 to 0 since clearing a calculator starts its value at 0.
Then they would type 3535+ followed by 244+, 23+, and 12+ finally reaching the sum 4292.
We summarize these steps by writing:
12+ 23+ 424+ 244+ 3535+ 54+ 0
Thus it is revealed that 54+ is an operation called "add 54 to" or "54 plus".
It is one of a wide family of operations e.g. 12+ "add 12 to" or 23+ "add 23 to"
Now, the expression
12+ 23+ 424+ 244+ 3535+ 54+ 0
becomes the successive composition of parametrized unary operators applied to 0.
Grouping with parenthesis will separate out the actions from the noun:
(12+ 23+ 424+ 244+ 353+ 54+) 0
It is this simple example which suggests a strong and far reaching generalization: use space, or a lack there of, to group and build and denote different compositions of actions.
One might write
(-12 12+ 8- +23) 0
for what is traditionally written (and should/still can be written conveniently as)
(12+8-23+0)-12
But, in the second case, we have removed any sense of successive actions.
There is also the issue of "ambiguity" as to whether -12 is an operation "minus twelve" or denotes a quantity "negative twelve".
The resolution of this ambiguity is found in the origin of negative quantities as a tool for recording debits and credits, or gains and losses.

Historically, the natural numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on were the only quantities worth considering as "actual", "real", or "existent" quantities.
(though it took some time for 0 to be thought of as denoting a quantity which could be "measured" as we tend to use the word today)
The idea which led to today's conception of "negative numbers" is found in recording gains and losses using natural numerals.
A gain of 3 and a loss of 4 would be interpreted as a net loss of 4.
The notion of "net loss" or "net gain" is born from the canonicalization of a table of gains and losses.
These canonical "net gains" or "net losses" are what developed into the modern mathematician's positive and negative numbers i.e. integers.

We consider a single trading event which is recorded as a quantity of gains and a quantity of losses.
A gain of 3 and loss of 4 is denoted 3n4
A gain of 5 and loss of 25 is denoted 5n25
A gain of 0 and loss of 15 is denoted 0n15
A gain of 3 and loss of 0 is denoted 3n0 or, simply, 3.
Thus the unary operation "negate", which is denoted either 0- or -: works as follows
   -:3
0n3
   0- 3
0n3
   0 - 3
0n3
   - 3
0n3
   -3
-3
In the last case -3 is a unary operation "minus three" where as - 3 is "negate 3".
Notice that "negate three" is a two word command and the verb "negate" is separated from the noun "three" by a space just as in - 3.
The convention that -:3 represents "negate 3" is from :'s use as an adverb when put right next to a verb.
There is much more that can be said about that later.

For those who object out right to the use of 0n3 to denote what is commonly referred to as "negative three" I will suggest a bit of patience, as many numbers are the result of this same general pattern, and we should consider the origins of such concepts as not only historically interesting but interesting from a pedagogical or behavioral perspective.

Consider fractions.
Given a pie we are asked how to share it among four children.
Certainly each child wishes to have part of the pie, and no one child would wish their part to be smaller than any other's part.
Since there are four children, the whole pie must be broken into four parts.
Since no child wishes to have less than another, the parts must be equal.
Finally, we give each child one of the four parts of the pie.
From this simple, and commonly occurring event, we get numbers for sharing i.e. fractions.
The one part each child receives from the whole pie is said to be "one forth" of the pie.

Suppose a party is planned and eight children are to be there.
The pie is cut into eight parts, each being equal to the other in order to eliminate any sense of "unfairness" among the children.
Due to inclement weather, only four children end up at the party.
These children, still wishing to have their fair share of pie, are given two out of the eight parts of the whole pie.
Thus, each child is said to have received "two eighths" of the pie.

The realization that "one forth" of a pie is the same amount of pie as "two eights" of a pie comes from comparing the relative sizes of the resulting collection of pie pieces.
Here "one of four parts" is denoted by 1f4 (though, ultimately the use of 'f' is inconsequential as long as it is easily distinguished from the other numeral notation introduced here).

The question "is one of four parts the same as two of eight parts" is asking whether two methods of dividing a whole into parts and then selecting some of those parts give the same quantity.
Here, the single trading event is an act breaking a whole into an equal number of parts and selecting a number of those parts.
We record such an event by making a table of the number of equal parts the whole is broken into and the number of parts selected.
So 1f2 records an event where some whole is broken into two equal parts and one of those parts is retained.
Similarly 2f4 records an event where some whole was split into four equal parts and two of those parts were kept.
The fact that a record of 1f2 is similar to a record of 2f4 (given the same whole) is what leads to the modern mathematician's notion of rational numbers.
The use of canonical records (e.g. 1f2 for 2f4 or 16f32) is what most people think of as "rational numbers" rather than the companion concept of "fractions".

What has been revealed thus far is a bit misleading.
Certainly, there is reason to have notation for "negative numbers" or "rational numbers" but is it necessary to separate -:3 from 0n3?
One could just as easily write 0-3 for 0n3 since 0n3 is the result of evaluating 0-3.
In general k-(3+k) gives 0n3 for any numeral k.
Ultimately, it is a matter of choice which notation is used in which situation, but it is important to know that 0n3 is a noun, a record of an event, where as 0-3 is a command which says "subtract 3 from 0" and in some contexts the one is much preferable to the other.

Similar statements apply to fractions when division is introduced.
Here 2%4 gives 1f2 which is the same as the result of 1%2 or 16%32.

What about negative fractions?
   -:2%4
0n1f2
Some people might find such numbers mixed with letters frightening, and that's okay.
One thing that this reveals though is a very important thing about fractional numerals: they are really triples of natural numerals.
The quantity denoted by 3n4f2 is equivalent to 0n1f2 and not 3n2f1.

One can also use (-2%3) to stand for 0n2f3, but the parenthesis matter in this case since - is only interpreted as "negate" because there is a parenthesis to its left and evaluation always precedes from right to left.

-2%3
-----
-2f3
-----
0n2f3

Notice that no parenthesis are used here.
That is because there is nothing else that the expression -2%3 is part of so it is easily known that - means "negate" in this context.

In the notation used here the result of evaluating (-2%3) is different from the result of evaluating (-2 %3).
As has been said (-2%3) gives 0n2f3 but

 -2 %3
-------
 -2 1f3
-------
 1f3-2
-------
1f3-6f3
-------
 0n5f3

There is certainly good reason for perhaps interpreting -2 %3 in a different way.
Some might wish for -2 %3 to give a vector 0n2 1f3.
For them there are at least two choices: (-2) (%3) or -:2 %:3.

Having gotten this far you might wonder if it's really all worth it.
Math seems to be doing fine without worrying about this unfamiliar notation that seems to say only what has already been said about math.
The "superficial" point of difference of this notation is that mathematical expressions built with this notation are immediately computable so that experimentation is as simple as with classical calculators only much more is expressible with only a minimal amount of new notation.

The true value, purpose, or relevance of this notation is hard to communicate because its fundamental point of difference either goes unseen by most mathematicians/computer scientists or is outright denied as being a "relevant" point of difference.
First, it promotes a finite perspective on mathematics.
Some use the words "constructive" or "intuitionistic", but neither is fully meant here.
A consequence of following this notational discipline is that the mathematics done is constructive, as far as "being constructive" has a well defined meaning in the first place.
Furthermore, results are "intuitionistic" in that they will not be beyond what can be expressed in an mathematics built on an intuitionistic logic.
But in both cases, neither constructivity nor intuitionistic constraints are what is aimed at.

As a slogan, one might say, as Leopold Kronecker did, that "God made the integers; all else is the work of man", but I would rather say that humans created numerals and all else is the work of humans.
Perhaps another slogan is Feynman's (or Dirac's or Mermin's) "Shut up and calculate".
Though their use of the phrase would permit mathematical tools which are denied here (specifically tools from non-recursive analysis).
