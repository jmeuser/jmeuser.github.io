Introduction of Numerals

A numeral is an occurrence of a zero or an occurrence of a successor of a 
numeral.
A numeral system is a collection of methods for introducing an occurrence of 
zero and introducing the successor of a numeral of the system.

Our first numeral system uses these rules:
1 write '0'; and
2 write '1+ 0' for '0' in a numeral.
Rule 1 gives the zero numeral and rule 2 gives the successor of a numeral of 
this system.

Here are example applications of these rules:

--- 1
 0


-------- 1
 0
-------- 2
 1+ 0
-------- 2
 1+ 1+ 0


 1+ 1+ 0
------------------ 2
 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
------------------ 2
 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
------------------ 2
 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0


Consequently,
0
1+ 0
1+ 1+ 0
1+ 1+ 1+ 0
1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0
are occurrences of numerals of this system.

It is possible to begin by constructing the familiar Hindu-Arabic positional 
numeral system.
The apparent complexity of the rules needed to do so dissuades their immediate 
introduction.
Alternatively, it can be introduced as an abbreviation for numerals of the 
current system.
Rather than give the entire system of abbreviation in full it will be given as 
needed.

Copying

All of math and science are born from and reducible to imitation and repetition.
Imitation is the behavior of performing similar behaviors.
It is possible to condition the performance of similar behaviors without 
observing imitation.
Thus, the occurrence of similar events of human behavior is not necessarily 
imitation.

Prior to similar events of human behavior were occurrences of similar events.
The extent to which we can clearly and exactly identify and describe the 
occurrence of similar events is often how we measure progress in math and 
science.

Copying is a type of imitation.
Copying is used to record events.
Some consequents of copying are more similar than others.

Abstraction, as an activity, is born from errors in imitation.

Similarity may also be seen as errors between occurrences of events.
Without errors between events, similarity would reduce to sameness making the 
occurrence of any event indistinguishable from the occurrence of another.
That different events occur seems to be basic.


Counting Small Collections

Counting is a foundation and origin of math.
To count is to name a tally.
A tally is a copy of a collection in marks.

  apple        orange       pear    collection
---------   -----------   -------   copy
.           | |       |   *   * *   tally 
  . . . .       |   |       *
                  |

A tally, being a collection of marks, can be copied.

.           | |       |   *   * *
  . . . .       |   |       *
                  |               collection
---------   -----------   ------- copy
|   |   |     * * * *     .       tally
  |   |     *         *     .
                              .
                                .

A tally tallies itself.
Systematic methods of tallying turn into counting.
Counting, as we know it, is an efficient way to record and communicate acts of 
imitation or, specifically, copying.


Counting Large Collections

Use an abacus.


Numerals

Numerals are introduced to abbreviate counting.
Some numeral systems are designed so that more complex mathematical activities 
can be performed quickly and consistently.

Modern decimal notation using Hindu-Arabic numerals has replaced almost all 
previously created numeral systems.
This is due primarily to its use in performing the fundamental algorithms of 
arithmetic:
addition;
multiplication;
subtraction; and
division.

The conceptual origins of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is in the use of the 
abacus to count large collections.

The act of copying an object from a collection in the acts of moving beads is 
encoded in a Hindu-Arabic numeral.

The numeral 123 abbreviates the events between the following antecedent and 
consequent of counting with an abacus

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o

   o    o    o 
   o    o    o

   o    o    o 
   o    o    | 
   o    |    o 
   |    o    o     
   o    o    o
 ===============

Whatever meaning we give to numerals and their use to count or record counts 
comes from the inference or induction we make from our records of events to the 
events that may have brought about those records.

By abstracting from counting with an abacus we can examine numeral independent 
of its occurrences or interpretations.
We do this to identify the unavoidable constraints on any numeral system we 
might decide to design in the future.

In anticipation of addition the notion of numeral is encoded with a verb "next 
numeral" denoted by '1+' and an initial noun zero denoted by '0'.

Here 1+0 might be interpreted as the following abacus events:

 ===============
   o    o    o  
   o    o    o
   o    o    o 
   o    o    o

 ===============

In general, a numeral is any system sufficiently similar to the following rules


--- Introduce Zero
 0

 0
--- Introduce Next Numeral
1+0

These rules are purely constructive, that is they are not conservative i.e. do 
not have symmetric elimination rules.

An example sequence of events following these rules:

----- Introduce Zero
  0
----- Introduce Next Numeral
1+0
----- Introduce Next numeral
1+1+0

Notice, these rules are all instances of copying with systematic errors.
The rule "introduce zero" is a command to copy nothing while introducing an 
error that looks like '0'.
The rule "introduce next numeral" is a command to copy an occurrence of '0' as 
an occurrence of '1+0'.
Specifically, in '1+0' the expression might be copied in the following stages

1
1+      this is the stage where the copy-error is introduced
1+1
1+1+
1+1+0

The reason for continuing to examine these excruciatingly "common/simple/basic" 
parts of math is because it really is the conceptual foundation for all modern 
mathematical behavior.


Elimination of numerals may be interpreted using modular arithmetic.


A Collection of Introduction and Elimination Schema

Iterative Definition Schema

The following pair of familiar expressions are given by Goodstein in RNT on pg. 
18

"
The common feature of all the definitions A to S is apparent; each definition 
takes the form

F(x,0)=a(x)
F(x,Sy)=b(x,F(x,y))

where F(x,y) is the function defined and a(x), b(x,y) are functions previously 
define for are variables or definite numerals.
" Goodstein RNT pg. 18

I've gone ahead and written them using the notation from his book, the 
classical notation.

Though his expression and discussion are consistent with his methods, they are 
not as transparent in their meaning as the following graphic presented using 
introduction and elimination rules via event schema.
The following are written using N notation.

      a y                 0 f y
    ----- introduce       ----- eliminate
    0 f y                   a y

y b x f y               S.x f y
--------- introduce   --------- eliminate
  S.x f y             y b x f y

The reason these schema are more representative of their use in defining 
functions is because they provide a sense of direction and show that the 
iterative schema of definition is conservative.
Specifically, one can not build an expression containing f without having 
established an expression from a or an expression from b and f of a certain 
form.
That this definition is "conservative" and is given by the symmetry of the 
introduction and elimination rules.
The pairing is important, and is the distinguishing feature of Goodstein's 
system.
Furthermore these schema give a guide for any notation hoping to capture 
definition by iteration for any future notation.

This iterative schema of definition is extracted from the similarity of the 
form of the defining equations for the following elementary arithmetic acts:

"
In standardized notation the definitions A, M, E, T and S take the forms

A
Sum(x,0)=x
Sum(x,Sy)=S(Sum(x,y))

M
Prod(x,0)=0
Prod(x,Sy)=Sum(x,Prod(x,y))

E
Exp(x,0)=1
Exp(x, Sy)=Prod(x,Exp(x,y))

T
Tet(x,0)=1
Tet(x,Sy)=Exp(x,Tet(x,y))

S
Dif(x,0)=x
Dif(x,Sy)=P(Dif(x,y))

where P(x) is x-.1 defined by

P(0)=0
PSx=x.
" Goodstein RNT pg.18

Goodstein then identifies what anyone would after looking at the iterative 
schema for definition long enough and wondering why b does not use y as one of 
its arguments.

"
Definition scheme I is called iteration; definition by iteration is a 
particular case of definition by RECURSION of which the scheme is

R
F(x,0)=a(x)
F(x,Sy)=b(x,y,F(x,y))

(The difference between iteration and recursion is that in the latter, function 
b depends upon y as well as upon x and F(x,y).)
" Goodstein RNT pg. 19

Using schema of a more modern form and the notational conventions of N the 
schema of recursive definition is depicted as follows:

          a y                     0 f y
        ----- introduce           ----- eliminate
        0 f y                       a y

(x,y) b x f y                   S.x f y
------------- introduce   ------------- eliminate
      S.x f y             (x,y) b x f y

Though, this is not how an experienced user of N notation would write these 
schema.
They would use the power of forks, and their abundance in everyday arithmetic 
to writhe these schema as follows:

      a y                 0 f y
    ----- introduce       ----- eliminate
    0 f y                   a y

x , b f y               S.x f y
--------- introduce   --------- eliminate
  S.x f y             x , b f y

For those unfamiliar with N's use of forks and hooks the expression 'x , b f y' 
is calculate as follows:

    x , b f y
----------------- eliminate fork
(x , y) b (x f y)

which gives the same expression as in the previous non-forked expression.
Why use forks?
Because under these schema definition and using N's tacit verb concept we can 
write:

  {0 f y} = {a y}
{S.x f y} = , b f

Or if one wanted to make expressions that are, in my opinion, more distinct and 
clear in their meaning and use of constant and projection functions:

 {0} f {y} =   a {y}
S{x} f {y} = , b f

Both expression are actually a pair of verbs/abbreviations/functions(but not 
'real' functions) themselves: they are not what a classical algebra student 
would interpret as a statement of equality.
This seems weird at first and pointless if you are not aware of how Goodstein 
uses equality.
His expressions, and his entire formal primitive recursive arithmetic, never 
explicitly uses functions: it uses symbols for what most people would call 
functions.
This subtlety seems to have been missed by anyone who has read his work.

The Integers
(Z. *. 0 &lt;) n means n is a positive integer e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
0 = n means n is zero
N. n means n is a natural number i.e. zero or positive integer
natural number line with origin labeled 0
(Z. *. 0 &gt;) n means n is a negative integer e.g. _1 _2 _3 _4 _5 _6 ..
Z. n means n is an integer (zero, positive integer, negative integer)
integer number line as iterated measurement from 0
addition as iterated motion on the number line
(Z. n) implies (n = n + 0) and n = 0 + n
n - ~ as (- n) +   subtraction as adding a negative
(Z. n) implies (0 = n + - n) and 0 = (- n) + n
n and - n are on opposite sides of 0 on the standard number line
read - n as "minus n" or "the additive inverse of n"

Rules For Addition

n = - - n                         idempotent
(- n + m) = (- n) - m             negation distributes over addition
(*. / 0 &lt; n) implies 0 &lt; + / n    positive additivity
(*. / 0 &gt; n) implies 0 &gt; + / n    negative additivity
(n = m + k) implies m = n - k     left solvable
(n = m + k) implies k = n - m     right solvable

((n + m) * k) = (n * k) + m * k   right-distributive
(- n) = _1 * n                    minus is multiplication by negative one
(- n * m)=(- n) * m               minus permutes over multiplication
(- n * m) = n * - m               minus permutes over multiplication
(n * m) = (- n) * - m
(n ^ k) = * / k #: n              exponentiation is iterated multiplication
(n ^ m + k) = (n ^ m) * n ^ k
(* / n ^ m) = n ^ + / m
(n ^ m ^ k) = n ^ m * k
(n ^ * / m) = ^ / n , m
((n + m) ^ 2) = (n ^ 2) + (2 * n * m) + m ^ 2
(*: n + m) = (*: n) + (+: n * m) + *: m
((n - m) ^ 2) = (n ^ 2) - (2 * n * m) + m ^ 2
(*: n - m) = (*: n) - (+: n * m) + *: m
((n + m) * n - m) = (n ^ 2) - m ^ 2
((n + m) * n - m) =(*: n) - *: m
n ((+ * -) = (*: [) - (*: ])) m

an arbitrary point on the graph of ]=a* has the form (1 , a) *
a point on the graph of ] = (- ]) is of the form (1 , -1) *
the graph of [ = (b + a *) is a straight line parallel to the graph of [ = a * ]
 y1 =: y - b so y1 = a * x with points of the form (x , a * x) and [ = (b + a 
*) are (] , (b + a *))
the slope of a line that is the graph of [ = (b + a * ]) is a
*. / (y0 = b + a * x0) , y1 = b + a * x1 implies *. / ((y1 - y0) = a * x1 - x0) 
, a = (y1 - y0) % x1 - x0
(a = (y - y0) % x - x0) iff ((y - y0) % x - x0) = (y1 - y0) % x1 - x0
0 = c + (a * x) + b * y  equation of a line

The Parabola
(y - b) = c * (x - a) ^ 2 is called a parabola

The Ellipse
((a , b) *) shear dilation
1 = + / *: (u % a) , (v % b) is an ellipse

The Hyperbola
c = x * y is a hyperbola

Rotation Of Hyperbolas
c = - / *: y , x
