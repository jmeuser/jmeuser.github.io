N
How will people know they need something they can't understand at a glance?
Accessible from the ground up.
Keep the formal stuff where it belongs (if you put it upfront then it will

Beautiful from the outside to the inside i.e. wears well as you get to know it 
better and as your thinking about math and computer science becomes clearer and 
more exact.
