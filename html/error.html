Programming Errors

This is a list of errors that I've made while programming.
It is organize chronologically.

While solving the HackerRank problem "Set .discard(), .remove() &amp; .pop()" I got this error

IndexError: list index out of range

from this code

input()
s={int(x) for x in input().split()}
I=[input().split() for x in range(int(input()))]
for x in I: eval('s.'+x[0]+'('+','.join(x[1])+')')
print(sum(s))

The problem was that x[1] referred to the second element of x when it should have referred to a potentially empty list of the remaining elements of x i.e. x[1] should have been x[1:].
The correct code is below.

input()
s={int(x) for x in input().split()}
I=[input().split() for x in range(int(input()))]
for x in I: eval('s.'+x[0]+'('+','.join(x[1:])+')')
print(sum(s))

While solving the HackerRank problem Sets - Symmetric Difference I came across an interest error in my thinking about the the sort method of lists.

Here is the code that I thought would work to solve the problem (the final solution can be found at jmeuser.github.io/html/hr.html under Sets - Symmetric Difference).

z=list((x.union(y)).difference(x.intersection(y))).sort()

where x and y are sets that were derived from the input.
I thought this code would set z to be a sorted list.
What it returned to z was actually nothing.
Specifically it returned this type error when I tried to iterate over it

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

Sorting occurs "in place" I guess and thus the correct code is as follows:

z=list((x.union(y)).difference(x.intersection(y)))
z.sort()

These two commands will make it so that z is now a list sorted in ascending order.
I must admit that I don't like these side effects: there must be some serious performance trade off for such terrible notation.

This python code was meant to be a solution to a simple Hacker Rank problem.
It asked to produce a pyramid of numbers using only the given for-loop and basic arithmetic.
The output should have looked like the following pyramid given an input of 4:
1
22
333
4444
But, as you can see in the code below, I tried to use ^ as the exponential operator.
In python ** denotes the exponential or power operator.
Alternatively, one can use pow(a,b) to denote a**b.

Error Code:

for i in range(1,input()):
    print(i*(10^i-1)/9)

Corrected code:

for i in range(1,input()):
    print(i*(10**i-1)/9)
