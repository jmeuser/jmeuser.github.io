Programming Errors

This is a list of errors that I've made while programming.
It is organize chronologically.

20150915T1337
This python code was meant to be a solution to a simple Hacker Rank problem.
It asked to produce a pyramid of numbers using only the given for loop and basic arithmetic.
The output should have looked like the following pyramid given an input of 4:
1
22
333
4444
But, as you can see in the code below, I tried to use ^ as the exponential operator.
In python ** denotes the exponential or power operator.
Alternatively, one can use pow(a,b) to denote a**b.

Error Code:

for i in range(1,input()):
	print(i*(10^i-1)/9)

Corrected code:

for i in range(1,input()):
	print(i*(10**i-1)/9)
