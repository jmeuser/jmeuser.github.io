space &amp; proportion
Design gives heuristics for discovering an ideal harmony between form and function.
To design is to seek out an equilibrium between point and counterpoint and to balance the credits and debits of our decisions.
We prototype to refine and detail our judgements and, ultimately, to enrich and engage our creative process by establishing constraints and conditions: data collected is pointless unless it has a point, a purpose, and a position in our design.
We search for symmetries between form and function by examining the steady states in the structure and regularity of our creative space.
This multiplex of abstraction must be condensed into concrete acts and constructions.
The coupling of the abstract with the concrete comes from a disciplined design, one whose problems have been understood and whose unknowns have been identified and captured using all tools under our control.
My sense of design is informed by these considerations, but, in the end, it is the unique combination of an individual's intellect and intuition that brings about that fitting surprise we so desperately desire from our design.
