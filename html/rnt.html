Notes on Recursive Number Theory by R. L. Goodstein

I've used an N like language to describe his work here.

Chapter I Definition by Recursion

1. Variables

"
In terms of two operations
1 replacing x by 1+x,
2 replacing x by 0,
we define numerals to be signs constructed from x by the repeated applications 
of the operation 1 followed by an application of operation 2.
Starting with the sign x the process of constructing numerals may be regarded 
as a process of eliminating x using only the operations 1 and 2.
" RNT Goodstein pg. 13

"
The defining property of a numeral variable x is that it may be replaced by 
zero or 1+x .
Any letter may of course serve as a numeral variable, but in this chapter only 
the letters x,y, z and w will be used.
By means of variables we can make general statements about numbers, statements 
which hold true when any particular numeral is substituted for the variable.
