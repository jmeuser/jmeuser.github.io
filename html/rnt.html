Notes on Recursive Number Theory by R. L. Goodstein

I've used an N like language to describe his work here.

Chapter I Definition by Recursion

1. Variables

"
In terms of two operations
1 replacing x by 1+x,
2 replacing x by 0,
we define numerals to be signs constructed from x by the repeated applications of the operation 1 followed by an application of operation 2.
Starting with the sign x the process of constructing numerals may be regarded as a process of eliminating x using only the operations 1 and 2.
" RNT Goodstein pg. 13

"
The defining property of a numeral variable x is that it may be replaced by zero or 1+x .
Any letter may of course serve as a numeral variable, but in this chapter only the letters x,y, z and w will be used.
By means of variables we can make general statements about numbers, statements which hold true when any particular numeral is substituted for the variable.
" RNT Goodstein pg. 13

Goodstein is missing a rule which permits the introduction of the letter x (or other rules for the other letters for that matter).
Such a rule is essential for it is the introduction of x that "starts" the whole game off.
(Alternatively it is that rule which introduces 'information' to the system.)

                            antecedent
--- introduce lowercase-ex  action
 x                          consequent

The rules 1 and 2 would be written schematically as

   x
----- introduce the successor of
 1+x

 x
--- eliminate lowercase-ex (Introduce zero)
 0

Interestingly, the rule 'Eliminate lowercase-ex' can also be thought of as 'Introduce zero'.

Notice also that Goodstein gives a simultaneous definition of numeral and numeral variable.
Oddly, it does not seem 'numeral variable' is what he has actually defined.
Rather, it seems he has defined numeral function, specifically the successor function.
It will be easier to see this after other arithmetic operations are introduced.

A numeral is the result of a sequence of events having the following form:

[1] Introduce lowercase-ex
[2] Introduce 1+ or stop.
[3] Eliminate lowercase-ex or go to [2].

For now, there is no way to say what method one must use to "replace x by 1+x".
This 'generalizing abstraction' is encapsulated in the event schema I've used above.

Antecedent and consequent events are referenced via intuitive pictures.
In these rules, the event 'an occurrence of a lowercase-ex' is referenced using an occurrence of a lowercase-ex.
The events 'between' the antecedent and consequent events are suppressed using either a single line or a double line.

Here a single line is denoted as repeated occurrences of a hyphen or minus-sign '-'.
A double line is denoted by repeated occurrences of an equality-sign '='.

The elision or reference to component events is of principle interest to mathematician in some instances and the philosopher or logician in others.

Those rules which are basic are likely to interest logicians or philosophers.
Those rules which are derived are likely to interest mathematicians or logicians.
The products of these rules and their methods are likely to interest scientists or engineers.

Using two rules one can describe just the numerals.

--- Introduce zero
 0

   0
----- Introduce the successor of
 1+0

There are multiple reasons for considering this simpler rule set.
One is the beauty of its simplicity.
One is it can be used to build a canonical system in which future systems may be interpreted.
An other is that it points to Kleene's generalized arithmetic from his Introduction to Metamathematics.
In this case there is just a single type of zero and successor where as in Kleene's generalized arithmetic there are many types of zero and successor.

To the general public mathematics is a behaviorally conditioned performance.
The use of schema is meant to reinforce this interpretation.
To 'do math' is to identify and act upon antecedent events which are structurally similar to those often labeled 'mathematical' so as to bring about the relevant consequent.
The specification of relevant antecedent and consequent events is an ongoing process.

Using the two rules just introduced a numeral may be defined via the following method:

[1] Introduce zero
[2] Introduce the successor of, stop, or go to [2].

Example results of these sequences of events are

0
1+0
1+1+0
1+1+1+0
1+1+1+1+0
