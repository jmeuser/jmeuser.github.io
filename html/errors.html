20151109T1342 Java local variables are not Assigned default values to 
uninitialized local variables
While solving a Hacker Rank problem I came across the following interesting 
error.
I was under the false impression that Java gave default values to variables 
that had been declared but not initialized, but this is not the case for local 
variables.
The error occurred while I was trying to run the following code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  long n = 0;
  while(sc.hasNext()){
   System.out.print(n+" "+sc.nextLine());
   n++;
  }
 }
}

The error report from the compiler was as follows:

Solution.java:7: error: variable n might not have been initialized
   System.out.print(n+" "+sc.nextLine());
                    ^
1 error

In this case the error message was absolutely correct: n had not been 
initialized.
In general, the lesson to learn from this error is to try not to use variables 
without immediately initializing them to some "default" value.
I would hope that future languages would always give a reasonable default value 
so that we would be only left with "logical errors" rather than syntactic 
errors.
Contrary to popular belief, logical errors can be eliminated with appropriate 
behavioral conditioning and have a larger pay off than the conditioning needed 
to eliminate syntactic errors.

The corrected code is as follows, but there is still an error (a logical one):

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  long n = 0;
  while(sc.hasNext()){
   System.out.print(n+" "+sc.nextLine());
   n++;
  }
 }
}

In fact there are two logical errors.
One of them is trivial, n needs to be initialized to 1 because I was asked to 
label the lines with numerals beginning with the numeral 1 not the numeral 0.
The other is that each line is to be printed on its own line (which seems 
obvious), but I was under the impression that sc.nextLine() returned a string 
which was terminated by a new line character, but running the code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  long n = 1;
  while(sc.hasNext()){
   System.out.print(n+" "+sc.nextLine());
   n++;
  }
 }
}

Gives the following output:

1 Hello world2 I am a file3 Read me until end-of-file.

Which clearly shows that no new line character was captured at the end of the 
String returned by sc.nextLine().
The fix is in the following (finally) correct code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  long n = 1;
  while(sc.hasNext()){
   System.out.println(n+" "+sc.nextLine());
   n++;
  }
 }
}

There is an alternate fix: instead of using println I could have simply 
happened the newline character to the end myself using the code:

System.out.print(n+" "+sc.nextline()+"\n");

I don't know which is clearer: I suspect its the solution with println.





20151109T1311 Java Literals: -9223372036854775808L is not -9223372036854775808
While solving a Hacker Rank problem I came across another silly mistake that 
has happened to me well before I started recording my errors systematically.
It is the problem of using "big" literals in your code.
Specifically, I tried to compile the following code (and it failed):

import java.util.Scanner;

class Solution{
 public static void main(String []argh){
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int t=sc.nextInt();
  for(int i=0;i&lt;t;i++) {
   try{
    long x=sc.nextLong();
    System.out.println(x+" can be fitted in:");
    if(-128&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=127)System.out.println("* byte");
    if(-32768&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=32767)System.out.println("* short");
    if(-2147483648&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=2147483647)System.out.println("* 
int");
    if(-9223372036854775808&lt;=x &amp;&amp; 
x&lt;=9223372036854775807)System.out.println("* long");
   }
   catch(Exception e){
    System.out.println(sc.next()+" can't be fitted anywhere.");
   }
  }
 }
}

First, I do not like this code, but much of it was already given to me and 
ultimately that fact is irrelevant to this error report.
My compiler gave me the following error message:

Solution.java:18: error: integer number too large: -9223372036854775808
                if(-9223372036854775808&lt;=x &amp;&amp; 
x&lt;=9223372036854775807)System.out.println("* long");
                    ^
Solution.java:18: error: integer number too large: 9223372036854775807
                if(-9223372036854775808&lt;=x &amp;&amp; 
x&lt;=9223372036854775807)System.out.println("* long");
                                                 ^
2 errors

The hint is that "integer number too large".
Java has the following kinds of literals as specified in "The Java Language 
Specification Java SE 8 Edition"

"Literal: IntegerLiteral
 FloatingPointLiteral
 BooleanLiteral
 CharacterLiteral
 StringLiteral
 NullLiteral
" The Java Language Specification Java SE 8 Edition pg.24

"
An integer literal may be expressed in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 
16), octal (base 8), or binary (base 2).
IntegerLiteral:
 DecimalIntegerLiteral 
 HexIntegerLiteral 
 OctalIntegerLiteral 
 BinaryIntegerLiteralDecimalIntegerLiteral: 
 DecimalNumeral [IntegerTypeSuffix]HexIntegerLiteral: HexNumeral [IntegerTypeSuffix]OctalIntegerLiteral: OctalNumeral [IntegerTypeSuffix]BinaryIntegerLiteral: BinaryNumeral [IntegerTypeSuffix]IntegerTypeSuffix: (one of) lLAn integer literal is of type long if it is suffixed with an ASCII letter L or 
l (ell);otherwise it is of type int (ยง4.2.1).The suffix L is preferred, because the letter l (ell) is often hard to 
distinguish from the digit1 (one).
" The Java Language Specification Java SE 8 Edition pg.25

Though I did not go on to read the reference to section 4.2.1 I was able to 
solve this problem by realizing that the compiler thought -9223372036854775808 
needed to be put into an int rather than a long, and hence it claimed that 
-9223372036854775808 was "too large" because it was trying to put it in an int.
The solution is to tell the compiler that the number -9223372036854775808 is to 
be interpreted as a long literal by appending a capital-ell to the end of the 
string: -9223372036854775808L.
Thus the corrected code is as follows:

import java.util.Scanner;

class Solution{
 public static void main(String []argh){
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int t=sc.nextInt();
  for(int i=0;i&lt;t;i++) {
   try{
    long x=sc.nextLong();
    System.out.println(x+" can be fitted in:");
    if(-128&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=127)System.out.println("* byte");
    if(-32768&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=32767)System.out.println("* short");
    if(-2147483648&lt;=x &amp;&amp; x&lt;=2147483647)System.out.println("* 
int");
    if(-9223372036854775808L&lt;=x &amp;&amp; 
x&lt;=9223372036854775807L)System.out.println("* long");
   }
   catch(Exception e){
    System.out.println(sc.next()+" can't be fitted anywhere.");
   }
  }
 }
}





20151108T1321 Opening files in a specific application from within Terminal 
Version 2.6 (361)
Using the command

$open x

where x is a file name will open x in the whatever application the OS thinks is 
appropriate for that file.
Thus, if you input

$open x.java

the OS will take it upon itself to open this in Xcode (for example).
Sadly, that is not what I wanted.
I wanted to simply view a file x.java in TextEdit (I can't even remember why I 
wanted to do this honestly).
I discovered that the following solves the problem:

$open -a TextEdit x.java





20151108T1239 Java, Scanner, .nextInt(), .nextLine() and '\n'
One must be careful when using a Scanner in order to get data of differing 
types.
Specifically, if you are using a Scanner to get an integer at the end of a 
line, and then you want to read in the next line as a String you must remember 
that .nextLine() will give you the remainder of the current line before it will 
skip over a '\n' in order to get at the "next line".

The following Java code showcases how you might work around this problem.
In general, parsing is never as easy as it seems.

/*
This example shows that you must be careful when reading tokens using a scanner.
Reading a token that is "at" the end of a line does not put the scanner "past" 
the new line character which is "really at" the end of a line.
If you read an int from a string like "12\nHello\n" then a .nextLine() gives 
"\n" not "Hello\n".
*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class temp{
 public static void main(String[] args){
  String x;
  x = "12\nHello World\n";
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(x);
  int y = sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println(sc.nextLine()); // prints the newline character to stdout
  String s = sc.nextLine();
  System.out.printf("%-15s%05d%n",s,y);
 }
}





20151104T1353 java is not javac
A common mistake, which brought me back to my first experiences with Java over 
five years ago, is to use the command "java" from the command line instead of 
using the command "javac".
The "c" in "javac" stands for compile, which is exactly what you want to do to 
a plain text document.
The particular problem I had was silly, I was trying to check the my JDK 
installation had gone smoothly by writing the simplest little Hello World 
program as prescribed in the oracal/java tutorial and got the following error:

Error: Could not find or load main class HelloWorldApp.java

At which point I realized I had written:

$java HelloWorldApp.java

instead of the correct solution which is:

$javac HelloWorldApp.java

Once I did the right thing I was able to get everything working and knew that, 
as far as I know, I've probably installed the JDK to my mac.
My fingers are now crossed that I do not have any of the trouble that some 
people seemed to have when they were working with Java during the lifetime of 
OS X Yosemite.





20151104T1339 JRE is not JDK
I made the mistake of installing jre-8u65-macosx-x64.dmg instead of 
jdk-8u65-macosx-x64.dmg and was surprised when I went to Terminal.app and typed 
in "java" and "javac" only to be confronted by the message

Error: No Java runtime present, requesting install.

Which made me scratch my head a little.
The solution was, as I have already said, to install the latest JDK rather than 
the latest JRE.
The Java Developer Kit contains all those tools that you need in order to work 
at developing with java on your machine, but the Java Runtime Environment is, 
as it obviously says, only what is needed in order to run a program compiled 
into Java bytecode.
The JDK lets you write plaintext then compile to Java bytecode and then lets 
you use a Java virtual machine which is part of the JRE to actually run the 
compiled bytecode on your local machine through the Java virtual machine.





20151010T1535 \r and \n
Always check to see whether \r or \n are used to indicate "new lines"
The following code was written as a solution to the HTML Parser - Part 2 
problem at HackerRank:

from html.parser import HTMLParser
class hp(HTMLParser):
    def handle_data(self, x):
        if x!='\n':
            print('&gt;&gt;&gt; Data')
            print(x)
    def handle_comment(self, x):
        y = x.split('\n')
        if 1==len(y):
            print('&gt;&gt;&gt; Single-line Comment')
            print(*y)
        else:
            print('&gt;&gt;&gt; Multi-line Comment')
            for z in y:
                print(z)
N = int(input())
I = ''.join([input() for _ in range(N)])
p = hp()
p.feed(I)

The reason I used '\n' was because the problem statement said that I should not 
print data that is a single character '\n', but in the representation of the 
input (in the definition of I) I did not know that each line was ended with a 
'\r' instead of a '\n'.
Thus the corrected code is:

from html.parser import HTMLParser
class hp(HTMLParser):
    def handle_data(self, x):
        if x!='\r':
            print('&gt;&gt;&gt; Data')
            print(x)
    def handle_comment(self, x):
        y = x.split('\r')
        if 1==len(y):
            print('&gt;&gt;&gt; Single-line Comment')
            print(*y)
        else:
            print('&gt;&gt;&gt; Multi-line Comment')
            for z in y:
                print(z)
N = int(input())
I = ''.join([input() for _ in range(N)])
p = hp()
p.feed(I)





20151004T1300 HTMLParser : html.parser :: Python 2.x : Python 3.x 
The module HTMLParser from Python 2.x has been renamed html.parser in Python 3.x
It took a surprisingly long amount of time to figure this out even though I was 
reading about the HTML Parser directly from the python 3.x library 
documentation.
This is because my first introduction to the functions of this module was under 
the name from Python 2.x (HTMLParser) and my brain simply parsed html.parser as 
HTMLParser since that is the name of the class that I was trying to 





20151002T1031 El Capitan Mail: Unable to Send Outgoing Email
I tried to send an email from Mail today.
It must have been the first time I had tried to send an email after upgrading 
to El Capitan for after clicking the send icon a dialogue box popped down and 
said that I was unable to send a message because I hadn't selected an Outgoing 
Mail Server (SMTP).
My understanding of the situation was that by having an iCloud account I was 
using Apple's mail servers in order to send and receive email.
Interestingly, the dialogue box that popped down indicated that I should select 
one of the SMTP servers from below, but there was no list from which I could 
select anything: only a button for acknowledging that my message would not be 
sent.
At first I thought that all I would need to do is go to Mail's Preferences and 
Accounts and select an appropriate Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP).
Sadly, there was nothing to select.
The simplest solution at that point was to go to Internet Accounts and to log 
out of my iCloud account and log back in.
This worked, although it was very nerve racking as I wasn't sure what I would 
loose and what I wouldn't (even after being told what information would be 
removed and whether I wanted to save it on my local computer by a series of 
dialogue boxes).
Upon logging back on and restarting my computer, I was able to send mail again.
Sadly, I didn't have all of my mailboxes back.
The solution to that was to go under Mailboxes and select Rebuild.
That solved the problem.

This is the first error I've reported on that isn't strictly a programming 
error, and I hope to increase this pattern of reporting on errors outside the 
scope of pure programming.





20150930T1605 Always test your regular expressions against inappropriate inputs
Though the mistake I made wasn't exactly along the lines of breaking because of 
inappropriate inputs I am reminded of something I read in Stroustrup's PPP 
about giving the code for a program as an input to the program and seeing what 
happens.
I was solving a hacker rank problem which asked to create a regular expression 
for checking whether the input was a valid Roman Numeral.
I quickly Googled roman numeral notation as I couldn't remember what letters 
were used past ten.
The denominations are:

I one
V five
X ten
L fifty
C one hundred
D five hundred
M one thousand

and subtraction notation means that

IV four
IX nine
XL forty
XC ninety
CD four hundred
CM nine hundred

from which I wrote down the first few roman numerals in order:

I
II
III
IV
V
VI
VII
VIII
IX
X
XI
XII
XIII
XIV
XV
XVI
XVII
XVIII
XIX
XX
XXI

and so on.

From this I produced the following regular expression (after carefully 
consulting the Python 3.5 documentation)

'M{0,3}(CM|CD|D?C{1,3})(XC|XL|L?X{1,3})(IX|IV|V?I{1,3})'

and used it in this program:

from re import match
re='(M{0,3})(CM|CD|D?C{1,3})(XC|XL|L?X{1,3})(IX|IV|V?I{1,3})'
print('True' if match(re,input()) else 'False')

I submitted it and found that it failed on three test cases.
I thought that the problem was that I hadn't included notation so that the only 
string on the line was a roman numeral i.e. that I needed to put ^ at the 
beginning of re and $ at the end of re like so

'^M{0,3}(CM|CD|D?C{1,3})(XC|XL|L?X{1,3})(IX|IV|V?I{1,3})$'

In actuality, and after submitting my program with these changes, I still 
failed those tests.
It became immediately obvious to me that I was silly to write C{1,3} X{1,3} and 
I{1,3} because I needed to allow the case where there were no instances of 
either in their respective regular expressions.
The final corrected solution is:

from re import match
re='^(M{0,3})(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})$'
print('True' if match(re,input()) else 'False')





20150929T1039 Converging Substitutions in Strings
A hacker rank problem asked to replace all occurrences of ' &amp;&amp; ' with ' 
and ', and ' || ' with ' or '.
My first solution was as follows:

from re import sub
I=[input() for _ in range(int(input()))]
A=[sub(' &amp;&amp; ',' and ',x) for x in I]
A=[sub(' \|\| ',' or ',x) for x in A]
for x in A:
    print(x)

For most of the test-cases this code seemed to work perfectly.
For some it did not.
It became apparent that the problem was with the stages at which the 
substitutions occurred.
Here is the specific example input that revealed my error:

1
text &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; text

With my incorrect algorithm the output is as follows:

text and &amp;&amp; text

Notice that the second occurrence of ' &amp;&amp; ' was not replaced with ' and 
'.
This is because it is only after the substitution of ' and ' for the left most 
occurrence of ' &amp;&amp; ' that the second substring ' &amp;&amp; ' was 
actually formed.
That is, it is not until AFTER the substitution sub(' &amp;&amp; ',' and ',x) 
had been performed on the input string that the second substring ' &amp;&amp; ' 
would occur.
Thus, rather than needing a single pass, I needed to perform a convergent 
iteration of substitutions until the collected lines were no longer changed by 
a substitution.
Though this operation is easily called upon in J or k (as it is obviously 
primitive) it was not so difficult to implement the relevant behavior in python 
as follows:

from re import sub
I=[input() for _ in range(int(input()))]
A=I
B=[]
while A!=B:
    B=A
    A=[sub(' &amp;&amp; ',' and ',x) for x in A]
    A=[sub(' \|\| ',' or ',x) for x in A]
for x in A:
    print(x)

Though, I do not prefer this solution, as it does not seem properly "clear" or 
"clean", I was not motivated enough to go beyond this functioning correction to 
my initial logical error.





20150928T1527 Sorted Strings instead of Integers
In a Hacker Rank problem I was asked to read in a table of data and then to 
sort by its values down the k-th column.
My first solution was

I=[input().split() for _ in range(int(input().split()[0]))]
k=int(input())
O=sorted(I,key=lambda x: x[k])
for x in O:
    print(*x)

Which sorted I correctly, but the atoms of I were strings rather than integers, 
so the ordering was for strings, where as the question was asking that the 
input be ordered after interpreting it as a table of integers.
The correction is to convert each entry in the input table into an integer as 
it is being read in so that the sorting will take place with regards to 
integers rather than strings.
I.e. rather than sorting alphabetically they will be sorted numerically.
Thus the final correct code is as follows:

I=[[int(x) for x in input().split()] for _ in range(int(input().split()[0]))]
k=int(input())
O=sorted(I,key=lambda x: x[k])
for x in O:
    print(*x)





20150928T1121 replace 'import datetime' with 'from datetime import datetime'
While solving a HackerRank problem on dates and times in different timezones I 
came across a large number of interesting errors.
The most significant error was in my thinking that time was no big problem 
because computers must be great at keeping track of time.
While computers are great at keeping track of local time (for the most part, as 
long as you compute in a temperature controlled environment) there is little 
else they do well.
The largest error in time is that our methods of recording it are driving by 
politics over reason.
Thus, as long as time is a political problem, there will always be money for 
the poor programmer that must deal with computing across timezones and 
political barriers.
It is my desire that Knuth write some time management algorithms so that we 
might discover a data structure whose form is unavoidably necessary when 
dealing with time, but that is only a hope.

My original code was as follows,

import datetime
I=[[datetime.strptime(input(),'%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z') for x in range(2)] for 
_ in range(int(input()))]
O=[(x[0]-x[1]).total_seconds() for x in I]
for x in O:
    print(int(x))

There are actually two errors in this code, though one is much easier to fix 
than the other.
The question asked to take in two strings representing a time having the 
following form:

Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx

Below this descriptive string I was told that +xxxx recorded the timezone.
I later found out that it is actually a record of an offset from UTC which is, 
for now, a politically stable time throughout the world (as stable as any 
political thing can be).
I immediately Googled "Python 3.x time zones" and was bombarded with an endless 
stream of "oh god help us all" type posts.
I ignored them all and went straight to the Python documentation for 3.5 on 
datetime.
There it seemed that it was possible to deal with timezones in a 
semi-meaningful way.
The documentation told me that the .strptime() method was independent of the 
operating system or available C libraries so I chose to parse the string that 
way.
In the language described by Python for sending format information to 
.strptime() the date format used in the problem is given by this string

'%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z'

The %z part is the one that gave me the real trouble.
I thought that all I needed was to import datetime and use the method 
.strptime() on the inputs.
What I didn't understand was that datetime is both the name of a module and the 
name of a class in that module.
Furthermore, the module provides a .strptime() method that acts kind of like 
the .strptime() method of the class with the same name as that module.
One significant difference is that the module method doesn't deal with the 
timezone offset in the way that an object of the class does.
So over a two day period I struggled to understand if I was using the wrong 
module or not, when, the entire time, I was using the right module, but had 
been calling a module method rather than an object method.
Finally, the corrected code was as follows:

from datetime import datetime
I=[[datetime.strptime(input(),'%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z') for x in range(2)] for 
_ in range(int(input()))]
O=[x[0]-x[1].total_seconds() for x in I]
for x in O:
    print(int(x))

Though, there is still one error left.
This logical error is my having forgot that the absolute value of the 
difference between the given pairs of date times was needed not the signed 
difference.
So, thankfully, arithmetic with timedelta objects is mostly like that with 
normal numbers so all I needed to do is wrap the difference in an absolute 
value.

from datetime import datetime
I=[[datetime.strptime(input(),'%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z') for x in range(2)] for 
_ in range(int(input()))]
O=[abs(x[0]-x[1]).total_seconds() for x in I]
for x in O:
    print(int(x))

With that, I passed the tests, and realized I would never get back those two 
days of confusion ever again.
This is probably the best example of why you want to record errors you make 
while programming, because they tend to cross boundaries from logical to 
runtime and back again.





20150926T1405 Python: raw_input() from python 2.x became input() in python 3
I was solving a problem for my application to LaunchCode and was using an 
expression

[sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()]) for _ in range(int(input()))]

and couldn't understand why it was giving a weird syntax error (I was not able 
to capture the error, but I tried to recreate it on my personal computer)

SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

Here you can see that input() was called from the command line and I gave it 12 
12.
It then gives a syntax error.
I discovered, after some rapid Googling, that I had learned of input() as a 
Python 3.x command, and that in Python 2.x I should have used raw_input().
I'm still not certain what the "real" problem is because it is ultimately 
irrelevant.
I just need to know that input() in python 3.x means raw_input() in Python 2.x





20150923T1637 Python: List Items vs. List Slices
While solving the HackerRank problem "Set .discard(), .remove() &amp; .pop()" I 
got this error

IndexError: list index out of range

from this code

input()
s={int(x) for x in input().split()}
I=[input().split() for x in range(int(input()))]
for x in I: eval('s.'+x[0]+'('+','.join(x[1])+')')
print(sum(s))

The problem was that x[1] referred to the second element of x when it should 
have referred to a potentially empty list of the remaining elements of x i.e. 
x[1] should have been x[1:].
The correct code is below.

input()
s={int(x) for x in input().split()}
I=[input().split() for x in range(int(input()))]
for x in I: eval('s.'+x[0]+'('+','.join(x[1:])+')')
print(sum(s))





20150921T1539 Python: .sort() occurs "in place"
While solving the HackerRank problem Sets - Symmetric Difference I came across 
an interest error in my thinking about the the sort method of lists.

Here is the code that I thought would work to solve the problem (the final 
solution can be found at jmeuser.github.io/html/hr.html under Sets - Symmetric 
Difference).

z=list((x.union(y)).difference(x.intersection(y))).sort()

where x and y are sets that were derived from the input.
I thought this code would set z to be a sorted list.
What it returned to z was actually nothing.
Specifically it returned this type error when I tried to iterate over it

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

Sorting occurs "in place" I guess and thus the correct code is as follows:

z=list((x.union(y)).difference(x.intersection(y)))
z.sort()

These two commands will make it so that z is now a list sorted in ascending 
order.
I must admit that I don't like these side effects: there must be some serious 
performance trade off for such terrible notation.





20150915T1337
This python code was meant to be a solution to a simple Hacker Rank problem.
It asked to produce a pyramid of numbers using only the given for-loop and 
basic arithmetic.
The output should have looked like the following pyramid given an input of 4:
1
22
333
4444
But, as you can see in the code below, I tried to use ^ as the exponential 
operator.
In python ** denotes the exponential or power operator.
Alternatively, one can use pow(a,b) to denote a**b.

Error Code:

for i in range(1,input()):
    print(i*(10^i-1)/9)

Corrected code:

for i in range(1,input()):
    print(i*(10**i-1)/9)
