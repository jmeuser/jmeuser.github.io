Recurrent Problems

The Tower of Hanoi
Assume
 8 disks 'stacked in decreasing size on one of three pegs'
 move 'one disk at a time'
 never move 'one onto a smaller one'
 it is possible to 'transfer the entire tower to one of the other pegs'
'What is the best we can do?'
'How many moves are necessary and sufficient to perform the task?'
Assume there are n disks (generalize the problem)
'Look at small cases first'
'Name and conquer'
Define T n as the minimum number of moves that transfer n disks between pegs
Assume the following method transfers n disks
 transfer the n - 1 smallest to a different peg (T n - 1 moves)
 move the largest (1 move)
 transfer the n - 1 smallest onto the largest (T n - 1 moves)
Thus (1 &lt; n) implies (T n) &lt;: 1 + 2 * T n - 1
Note, to move largest disk, n - 1 smaller disks must be on a peg so &gt;: T n - 1 moves
Note, largest disk is moved at least once
Note, n - 1 smaller disks must be moved on largest disk so &gt;: T n - 1 moves
Thus (1 &lt; n) implies (T n) &gt;: 1 + 2 * T n - 1
Thus T satisfies the recurrence
 (T 0) = 0
 (T n) = 1 + 2 * T n - 1 for n &gt; 0
Note (T 0) = (2 ^ 0) - 1
Assume (T n - 1) = (2 ^ n - 1) - 1 then
 T n
 1 + 2 * T n - 1
 1 + 2 * (2 ^ n - 1) - 1
 1 + (2 ^ n) - 2
 (2 ^ n) - 1
Thus, by induction, (T n) = (2 ^ n) - 1
Note, when 'finding a closed form expression for some quantity of interest'
 'Look at small cases.'
 'Find and prove a mathematical expression for the quantity.'
 'Find and prove a closed form for a mathematical expression'

Lines in the Plane
Define L n as the maximum number of regions defined by n lines in the plane
Note 0 &lt; n implies nth line adds k regions iff it hits lines at k - 1 different points
Assume two lines intersect in at most one point
Thus nth line intersects n - 1 lines at less than n - 1 points
Thus (0 &lt; n) implies (L n) &lt;: n + L n - 1
