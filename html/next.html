 Bishop's Constructive Analysis is woefully inadequate from a finitists 
perspective, and I think that Goodstein has given more insight into the 
development of constructive mathematics through his Recursive Analysis than 
Bishop.
How will people know they need something they can't understand at a glance?
Accessible from the ground up.
Keep the formal stuff where it belongs (if you put it upfront then it will 
scare people away)
Beautiful from the inside out
wears well as you get to know it better and as your thinking about math and 
computer science becomes clearer and more exact.
