20150924T1602 Hardy, Littlewood, and PÃ³lya Inequalities
I read this book a while back, and happened to be tying my shoes in my closet today when my gaze came upon it.
I realized immediately that all the work I've been doing to develop N could be put to good use, or to good test, by translating and interpreting the arguments and result in N and seeing where they fit inside the arguments given by Goodstein in RNT.
Most importantly, HLP consider their work to cover the elementary inequalities in use throughout real, complex, and functional analysis.
My perspective on real, complex, and functional analysis is significantly different from theirs and most modern mathematicians, so it should be interesting to see where I can fit their results in my head.
The good thing is that HLP are smarter and wiser than I am likely to ever be, and their results are given in their most fundamental form which is what is of direct interest to me and my notational language N.

20150924T1553 Quotes and Goodstein's Introduction of Zero in FCOM
The main thing to remember is to keep the main thing the main thing.
Time stamp everything, you never know when you need to know when.
Well done is better than well said.
If it's meant to be then it's up to me.

Goodstein waits until page 43 to introduce the number zero!
It's brilliant and genius.
He gives zero meaning as a number by introducing it with modular arithmetic, or what he more aptly calls 'arithmetic of remainders'.
This is a design feature of Goodstein's perspective and methods.
He doesn't just want to do as much as he can with as little as he can.
He wants to do it in a clean, clear, and vivid way.
A way that humans can follow and that seems to almost be self justifying at each step.
Goodstein's Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics is a must read for any math teacher at the middle or high school level.
Not because middle or high school teachers will cover the material in it (they should, but it's unlikely they would), but because of the vivid perspective it gives on the part math plays in everyday life.
It's the only book of its kind that I've ever read (and I've read A LOT of math books, like a whole lot, and when I say I've read them, I mean I really went through and read every page, something that a lot of people tend not to do, especially when the book is really popular).
It's also interesting to note that Goodstein uses the sign 0 for counting with an abacus using standard decimal notation, but there it is a place holder, and the digit by itself is not yet recognized as a numeral i.e. not clearly denoting a thing that we will perform arithmetical acts with.
The reason it makes sense to introduce zero with remainders is because you can think of remainder as what is left over after you've taken away as many collections containing the dividend number of objects from the collection being divided.
It's genius, because it means that zero can be interpreted as what's left over after everything has been taken away.
At the same time, by deferring its introduction we avoid a massive number of questions about how best to define, via recursion, the basic operations of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, titration etc.
If you want a crystal clear description of the fundamental concepts of modern mathematics look no further than Goodstein's "Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics".



I want to build a list comprehension using the following code:
[[x,y] if 3!=x+y else [] for x in range(3) for y in range(4)]
but instead of inserting an empty list where the condition is not met, I want it to not do anything and just go on.
