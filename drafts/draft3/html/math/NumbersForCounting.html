    <h2>Counting</h2>

<div>What do we do when we count?</div>

<div>Counting is not labeling; numbers are not labels.</div>

<ol>
 <li>stock of number labels</li>
 <li>match a label with an item</li>
 <li>repeat 2 until there is not an item left to label</li>
</ol>

<div>The number of items labeled is not the last label matched to the last unlabeled item.</div>

<div>
The following demonstrates that the number of a collection of items can not be the last label matched to the last unlabeled item of the collection.
</div>

<div>GRAPHIC</div>

<div>
The last label assigned to the second row is 7 and the last label assigned to the third row is 1. These are not the same label. Assuming that the number of items in a collection is not altered by the method of labeling and matching, then the number of items in a collection can not be the last label matched to the last unlabeled item as witnessed by the previous example.
</div>

<div>To label is a special form of naming.</div>

<div>Why chose these labels? Are the signs 1,2,3,...,9 special in some way? Would not signs such as |, ||, |||, etc be just as good?</div>

<div>
Counting is not keeping and using labels in a definite order.
</div>

<div>
The simplest example of such labels are the conventional letters in your native language's alphabet since they are usually learned in a specific order e.g. a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,...,x,y,z. Using the letters of our alphabet as labels and matching a label to an item using either 'a' as the first, or the letter following the last letter matched to an item we produce the following examples.
</div>

<div>
In each case the last label used is 'g'. In this case all is well, though the following example introduces a limitation and ultimately an error in saying that counting is labeling in order from a kept collection of labels.
</div>

<div>GRAPHIC</div>

<div>
Having exhausted the letters of our standard alphabet, we are unable to match a next letter after 'z', to the last unmatched item. This problem can be solved in this case by introducing more letters to the alphabet. perhaps the capital letters so that 'A' follows 'z', 'B' follows 'A', and so on. The following example reveals the error in using this extended alphabet as the ordered labels.
</div>

<div>
Using all the letters from all the alphabets and committing to memory which letter follows the previous letters we can easily produce collections of items of ever greater complexity.
